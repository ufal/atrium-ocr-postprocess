text_util.py

Purpose:
Provides the core text-processing utilities for the ALTO OCR post-processing pipeline.
This includes functions for detecting OCR noise, calculating character/symbol density,
scoring word "weirdness", and running text chunks through a GPU-accelerated Perplexity model.

Categories Outputted:
  - Empty     : A blank line.
  - Non-text  : Lines that are too short, lack letters, or are purely numbers/symbols.
  - Trash     : Severe OCR corruption, high symbol density, gibberish, or failed language ID.
  - Noisy     : Partially degraded text (e.g., isolated strange symbols, mid-word uppercase).
  - Clear     : Structurally sound text with low perplexity.

Those five, and only those five, are what this module writes into `lines[].categ`.
They are bound to the CATEG_* label constants below (collected in
CATEGORIES_EMITTED) and cross-checked at import time against the hub registry,
atrium_vocab.LINE_CATEGORY_ORIGINATORS["alto-postprocess"]. The same block's other
authorised originator, digital-convert, emits a DISJOINT set ({Garbage, Inverted});
that is deliberate and is not drift to reconcile.

# The five strings below are the ONLY values this module ever writes into

# registry, and that direction is deliberate:
#
#   * these strings ARE the emitted contract. Deriving them would make a stale or
#     re-ordered vendored copy of atrium_vocab.py silently change what the
#     pipeline outputs -- the registry is a description of behaviour, not a knob
#     that steers it;
#   * `lines[].categ` has a SECOND authorised originator (`digital-convert`, in
#     atrium-llm-enrich) which emits {Garbage, Inverted}. The two sets are
#     disjoint ON PURPOSE -- one is an OCR verdict over a rendered image, the
#     other a decode-sanity verdict over an embedded text layer -- so "align the
#     two" is never the fix for a disagreement found here.
#
# The registry's role is therefore advisory only: the check below reports a drift
# between this file and the hub declaration and then gets out of the way. See
# defect V-1 in the hub's docs/skos_strategy.md for why a consumer that filters
# this field must handle BOTH sets.
#
# Naming note: the CATEG_*_SCORE_MAX / CATEG_GARBAGE_DENSITY_HIGH constants further
# down are quality-score THRESHOLDS, not labels. Same prefix, different kind. And
# "Process", which pre_filter_line() also returns, is NOT one of these: it is the
# routing sentinel meaning "no verdict yet, score this line" (classify_TEXT.py gates
# on `cat != "Process"`), and it never reaches lines[].categ.

# own predicate, and the flag that gates each. A rule listed here reports
# `fire_count == 0` on every corpus while its flag is off -- not because it has
# no population, but because the branch is unreachable by configuration.
#
# This exists because `tools/rule_coverage_report.py` could not tell the two
# apart. Its `_classify()` reads `fire_count == 0` and returns DEAD, whose own
# docstring says the rule "is unreachable dead code and can be permanently
# deleted ... because deletion provably changes nothing". For
# `rule_short_garbage_witness` that is false in the most expensive possible way:
# the 2026-09-21 stage-6 sweep classified it DEAD and recommended retirement,
# while stage 08f had measured the same predicate reaching 100,824 lines across
# both collections and stage 08b had flipped the flag and passed the adoption
# gate (McNemar p = 0.01294). `RULE_COVERAGE.md` called `fire_count == 0` the
# "config-independent" retirement criterion; it is exactly not that.
#
# The taxonomy is not new -- `tests/test_pipeline_parity.py::UNREACHABLE_RULES`
# already separates "unreachable BY CONFIGURATION" from gate shadowing
# (`rule_mid_uppercase`, shadowed by gate 7). It lived only in a test, so no
# tool could read it. This is that distinction, sited next to the flag it is
# about, so a future flag-gated rule has one obvious place to declare itself.

    since then it carries @david-spacil's reviewed entries (#30 Q5a, PR #7), so
    every caller below is live for those words and for nothing else.

    WHAT IT MEANS, TWICE OVER. (1) The shape witness never reads it as evidence
    of damage: `shape_garbage_clauses()` skips it (#30 Q5b, answered yes on
    2026-10-01). (2) The token contributes NOTHING to the line's quality score. It
    stops counting toward the invalid-word, weird-word, gibberish and fused-word
    measurements -- which together are 0.60 of the score's weight. It does not
    count as a GOOD word either: `compute_valid_ratio` treats it as non-evaluable,
    the way `_is_neutral_token` already treats a unit. "Not debuffed" is the ask;
    actively raising the ratio would be more than the ask.

    MATCHING IS EXACT, case-folded and `_STRIP_CHARS`-stripped, and deliberately
    does NOT fold diacritics -- unlike `_NOTATION_LABELS_FOLDED`, which does.
    Folding here would mean that listing `jáma` also excuses `jama`, i.e. the
    accent-stripped form OCR produces when it fails. That is the damaged reading,
    and a list of words the archive says are real should not quietly also cover
    the ways they come out wrong. An archive that wants both lists both.

    (``"2, Popis nálezu i - 3"``, ``"Plánek č. 1"``) and bare domain
    abbreviations (``mm``, ``Tb.``, ``č.neg.``) that would otherwise mis-route
    to Trash/Non-text purely because the digits/symbols around one or two real
    words drag ``valid_word_ratio`` down.

    Every token is classified as one of:
      * NUMBERING  — a pure digit (short numbering only, see
        ``HEADLINE_MAX_DIGITS``) or a roman numeral. Supplies *context*.
      * ABBREV     — a known unit/abbreviation (``SHORT_EXCEPTION_TOKENS``), an
        academic title, or a ``METADATA_MARKERS`` marker. Supplies both
        *content* and *context* (a bare ``mm`` line qualifies on its own).
      * FUNCTION   — a whitelisted short Czech word (``SHORT_VALID_WORDS`` /
        ``SINGLE_CHAR_ALLOWED``). Real *content*, but no context by itself.
      * CLEAN WORD — passes the same acceptance test as ``compute_valid_ratio``'s
        inner branch, plus a vowel-bearing check. Real *content*, no context.
        Multi-token lines only: a single bare "clean-looking" word is exactly the
        profile of an inverted-scan / short-garbage token (``oueussd``, ``olie``)
        that rule_inverted / rule_short_garbage exist to catch.
      * STRUCTURAL — pure punctuation: no information either way.
      * GARBAGE    — anything else, and disqualifies the whole line.

    A line is forgiven only when it carries BOTH real *content* (a clean word,
    abbreviation, or function word) AND genuine numbering/abbreviation *context*
    (a digit, roman numeral, or domain abbreviation). Requiring the context term
    is what keeps a bare short prose fragment (``"popel dřevo kůstky"``) — no
    numbering, no abbreviation — out of the forgiveness path; those must route on
    their own quality score, exactly as before this pass. Every DanaKriv example
    carries such context (``2, ...``, ``4. ...``, ``Plánek č. 1``, ``mm``).

    Deliberately tight: a single OCR-mangled token (``oAOrt``, ``vyt1ačená``)
    or an over-long digit run (an archive/stamp code, not a caption number)
    disqualifies the line, so genuine garbage is never rescued.

    # A recognised address gets whatever category `DOMAIN_NOTATION_CATEG` names,
    # and EVERY address the pattern catches gets it -- not only the short ones.
    # That is the point: `http://www.arub.cz` and
    # `roku 1820 (http://www.hrady.cz/index.php?OID=1291).` are the same kind of
    # thing to a reader, and today they land in different categories for reasons
    # that are about token counts rather than about the address.
    #
    # WHY IT IS FIRST, above even the hard sweep. Every signal below this line
    # measures how word-like a string is, and an address is not trying to be a
    # word: `weird_ratio` is 1.00 on `http://www.arub.cz` because every character
    # a URL needs past the letters is a symbol, `detect_fused_words` fires on the
    # address shape rather than on a fusion, an `@` halves `valid_word_ratio`, and
    # perplexity on a domain name is noise. Letting those decide and then
    # correcting them afterwards is how this one line has had three different
    # answers in this issue. If the archive has a rule for addresses, the rule is
    # the answer.
    #
    # The `notation` exemption at gates 1a/1b is narrower and stays: it covers
    # every notation shape (sigla, grid references, labels), where the perplexity
    # routes are wrong but the rest of the cascade is not, and it deliberately
    # does NOT exempt `rule_hard_sweep`. This route is only the URL/e-mail
    # sub-shape, and only once an operator has said what that shape is worth.
    #
    # KNOWN LIMIT, measured rather than assumed: nothing here separates a
    # correctly scanned address from a mis-scanned one. `e-mail: officeauappmost.cz`
    # -- the same label with its `@` lost to the scanner -- already reads `Clear`
    # today without this route. A configured category therefore applies to both,
    # and `Noisy` is the honest setting for an archive that minds the difference.

# ── rule_short_garbage shape witness (issue #30) ────────────────────────────
# A SECOND WITNESS for the short-line garbage route, alongside
# _has_strong_garbage_evidence(). It exists because that predicate returns False
# on the ENTIRE population issue #30 is about -- valid_word_ratio 1.0 (because
# compute_valid_ratio is shape-only), weird_ratio ~0.28-0.35, gibberish 0,
# garbage_density 0.0, and a lang clause that fails on its FIRST conjunct at
# trust-tier scores of 0.28-0.92. Pinned by
# tests/test_calibration.py::test_strong_evidence_is_false_on_the_entire_disputed_population.
# So on those lines "require a second witness" is not a narrowing of the rule;
# there is no second witness to consult, and the rule simply stops convicting.
#
# SHAPE, NOT IDENTITY. It answers "is this spelled the way no European word is
# spelled?", which characters can decide. It does not answer "is this a word?",
# which they cannot: `edelite` is phonotactically legal and stays out of reach.
# That residue is the part of #30 that genuinely needs a lexicon (D14).
#
# What is REUSED from detect_fused_words(): the vowel-run test and its vowel
# class, and nothing shared any more. It used to be _RE_FUSED_VOWEL_RUN by
# reference, so FUSED_VOWEL_RUN_MIN steered both; the witness now compiles its
# own (_compile_vowel_run), and the run length comes from
# SHORT_GARBAGE_WITNESS_VOWEL_RUN_MIN and the D44 language split
# (_vowel_run_min_for). FUSED_VOWEL_RUN_MIN only supplies the default.
#
# What is deliberately NOT reused, and why -- each of these was measured, and
# each has a test naming the counterexample:
#
#   * `len(core) > 14`, detect_fused_words' third clause. Flags
#     `Skelettmaterial`. Length is not evidence of garbage in a compounding
#     language. See test_long_compound_is_not_witnessed.
#
#   * _RE_FUSED_CONSONANT_RUN (5+ consonants). Flags `vrstva`, `vrstvy`,
#     `vrstvou`, `vrstvami`, `ctvrtek`, `ctvrt`, `zmrzl`, `scvrkl` -- ordinary
#     diacritic-free Czech, and `vrstva` ("layer") is the commonest noun in
#     archaeological field documentation. `vrstva 3` satisfies every condition
#     of the short-garbage route at production signals, so a witness carrying
#     this clause would Trash it. Nothing is lost by dropping it: `sektlll` and
#     `Tthts I` are reached by the triple and geminate tests instead. See
#     test_consonant_run_czech_is_not_witnessed.
#
#   * _has_repeated_run() / detect_repeated_chars(). Looks like the same idea
#     and is not: it fires on `Kaaden` (aa) and `Pinii` (ii), both #30 fixtures
#     that must survive. Unifying the two would either widen this predicate or
#     narrow a detector that feeds compute_quality_score corpus-wide.
#
# detect_fused_words() itself is untouched for that last reason -- it feeds the
# `fused_ratio` term of the quality score and the `fused_words` CSV column, so
# narrowing it would move scores on every line in the corpus, not just here.
#
# KNOWN false positives of the vowel-run clause: Latin/French/German loans with
# a 3+ vowel run (`Poaceae`, `Naiade`, `Beaune`, `Radiouhlik`,
# `Sauerstoffflasche`). Most carry weird_ratio 0.0 and so never reach the route
# at all -- a real but THIN margin, since it depends on a signal outside this
# predicate. Measuring that class against annotated lines is a precondition for
# enabling the flag, not a follow-up.
# WIRED, BUT OFF (#30 D15). PR #48 merged as `070620f`, creating the conditional
# this predicate joins, and the witness is now read at gate 6 of
# `determine_category()` as a second disjunct beside `_has_strong_garbage_evidence()`.
# Gate 6 is the only site in the short-line path that returns `Trash`; section 7's
# `damage` branch returns `Noisy`, so a witness placed there could never restore a
# `Trash` verdict.
#
# `SHORT_GARBAGE_WITNESS_ENABLE` still defaults to false, so the disjunct cannot
# change any outcome. Wiring and enabling are separate on purpose: the flag must
# not be flipped until the witness is measured against a GOLD set.
#
# UPDATE 2026-09-10 -- it has been measured once, and it did not pass. On the 508
# annotated lines, flag-on moved 26: 12 fixed, 12 BROKEN, 2 borderline. Every
# break carried a roman numeral, which the exemption in the predicate below now
# clears. That exemption is a narrowing, not a green light: the 508 have NOT been
# re-scored against it (that needs the delivered batch, which is not in the
# tree), so the flag stays false.
#
# UPDATE 2026-09-23 -- the gold A/B exists now. On the 2,064-row sidecar the flag
# passes the adoption gate (stage 10e: errors 513 -> 503, `Clear`-loss unchanged,
# p = 0.013; with the D44 split, 12 fixes / 1 break), and @david-spacil's re-score
# of the 508 on `3b02959` reads 326 -> 336 with one break. The flag still ships
# false: those labels reach 23 of the ~20k lines the witness fires on, so it now
# waits on the annotation ask (docs/issue30/census.csv + sample.csv) and the open
# questions in docs/issue30/README.md, not on code.
#
# UPDATE 2026-10-01 -- the annotation is back (docs/issue30/census.csv + sample.csv,
# 249 of 357 rows labelled, every blank non-Czech). Text-only with this
# predicate and no lexicon: projected tail errors 4,844 -> 1,180, census head
# 339 -> 358 (decipherable damage, which this route answers `Trash`; Q6 keeps
# that), `Clear`-loss 0 -- after D46 below, which her two `Clear` labels found.
# The flag stays false until stage 12 scores the same labels on the real lines
# with the lexicon armed (tools/project_annotation.py join).
#
# UPDATE 2026-10-01, evening -- stage 12 did, and the projection above is the
# witness's verdict on TEXT, not its effect: this gate consults it only behind
# the signal half above, and on Dana's 826 lines the armed run moved about 26
# (errors 648 -> 642; gold 2,064: 510 -> 499, p = 0.0034, Clear-loss flat). The
# flip rule is met and the flag is held for #30 D47 (a witness floor outside this
# gate) and stage 13.
#
# The annotations themselves are now here -- tools/gold/sidecars/, joined onto a
# delivered batch with `--gold-sidecar`; see tools/gold/GOLD.md, including its
# provenance note on the 55 labels that changed when the 508 were re-annotated.
# Flipping the flag also means moving the four SHORT_GARBAGE_WITNESS_* constants
# out of `_DELIBERATELY_NOT_TUNABLE` and into `_THRESHOLD_NAMES` + `SEARCH_SPACE`,
# in the same commit.

# recognises the hyphenated form -- `S-VIII-b` and `B-XII-c` both return True --
# and the unhyphenated twin differs from it by one character, so this is a
# near-miss in that predicate rather than a new class. The roman-numeral exemption
# does not reach it either: `_split_subtokens` yields `VIIIb`, and the fused
# lowercase letter keeps `_RE_ROMAN_TOKEN` from matching, so `vowel_run` (`III`)
# and `triple` convict it.
#
# Exempted HERE, witness-locally, and NOT by widening `is_domain_notation()`,
# which is also read by `rule_short_garbage`'s outer guard and by the two
# perplexity-only routes. Widening it there would change production behaviour for
# these strings while the witness flag is still false; here it cannot change
# anything until the flag flips -- the discipline the roman-numeral and taxonomy
# exemptions follow.
#
# Measured on the 822-document corpus: seven distinct strings, one excavation's
# grid series -- AA-VIIIb, E-VIIIb, F-VIIIb, J-VIIIb, K-VIIIc, L-VIIIb, S-VIIIb --
# across 7 witnessed lines, 6 of them currently Clear. `S-VIIIb` is annotated
# `Clear` in tools/gold/sidecars/issue30_gold_2067.csv, and on the gold surface
# this guard vetoes exactly that line and none of the gold-Trash catches.
#
# HISTORY, because this guard has already been lost once. Added 2026-09-18
# (`9bc218b`) and measured in the round-2 stage-5a re-run; deleted the same
# evening by `cc4990e`, a lexicon commit whose diff it was not otherwise part of,
# together with the German-diacritic veto `has_expected_lang_diacs()`. No test
# pinned either, so nothing noticed until @david-spacil's 508-line re-check on
# 2026-09-23 found `S-VIIIb` among the witness's two breaks on the default config.
# With a lexicon configured `viiib` is attested and survives anyway; the shipped
# config has none, which is why the guard matters. Restored on his report, and
# now pinned by tests/test_shape_witness_vocabulary.py. The German veto was NOT
# restored with it: the D44 language split now overlaps it, and it needs its own
# measurement (30.plan.md D45).

# (#30 D46) Punctuation that joins two words without a space. `_split_subtokens`

# `erhalten,Siedelungsfund,gefunden` as ONE 30-letter token. On a token that long
# `low_variety` fires on alphabet saturation alone -- a long string simply runs
# out of new letters -- and a roman numeral fused by a comma (`XXX,1937,str`,
# `III,konec`) no longer looks like a roman numeral to `_RE_ROMAN_TOKEN`.
#
# Found in @DanaKriv's 357 decisions (2026-10-01, docs/issue30/census.csv): the only
# two at-risk lines she labelled `Clear` are exactly these, `XXX,1937,str. 21`

    to compare one token's frequency against another's; that guard is gone
    (#30 D40, 2026-09-22) but the mapping stays, because the frequencies are what
    ``min_df`` filters on here and what ``build_token_lexicon.py``'s provenance
    header and per-collection columns are for. A set plus a parallel frequency
    dict would be a second copy of this vocabulary and so a second thing to
    drift, which is the argument already made for SHAPE_GARBAGE_CLAUSES.
    Membership tests and ``bool()`` read identically on a mapping, so every
    existing caller is unaffected. The proxy is because the result is cached: a

    up inside one process, which the test suite relies on.

    A comment is a line that starts with ``#`` AND CARRIES NO TAB. Both halves
    are load-bearing: ``#`` is not in ``_STRIP_CHARS``, so the builder emits
    tokens like ``#rdisico`` verbatim, and 27 of them appear in the first real
    822-document table. Skipping every ``#``-initial line dropped them at load
    with no symptom other than a count being quietly wrong. No escaping scheme is
    needed to tell the two apart -- a header line has no tab (``# columns:
    token<TAB>document_frequency`` is literal text), a data line always does.

    A malformed or unreadable table yields an EMPTY set rather than an exception.

    (#30 D14.) The residue the shape witness cannot reach -- `edelite`,
    `vfetennl k.` -- is phonotactically legal, so no character-level test
    separates it from `malakofauna`. Both sides of the issue thread concluded the
    way out is a lexicon; the external Czech ones are CC BY-NC-SA, which would
    change this pipeline's output-licence story, so this uses the corpus as its
    own dictionary.

    The signal is DOCUMENT frequency, not line frequency and not category: a
    token that appears in many distinct documents is vocabulary, because OCR
    noise is idiosyncratic to the scan that produced it. Document frequency is a
    property of the data, so consulting it does not re-introduce the circularity
    of scoring against the pipeline's own labels -- which is the mistake this
    issue has already made once, in the sweep objective.

    Veto only: it can withdraw a conviction, never add one.

    KNOWN LIMIT, and it is now accepted rather than carved out (#30 D40,
    2026-09-22). The premise above -- that OCR noise is idiosyncratic to its
    scan -- FAILS for a pre-printed form scanned across the collection: there the
    error is systematic, reproduces once per document and accrues document
    frequency exactly like a word. A de-gemination guard used to carve that shape
    out, letting the witness convict a doubled-initial token although the table
    attested it. It is gone, on the data provider's answer and on measurement:

    * `ppole` (`KULTURA: ppole`) is not the artefact the guard was built for --
      it is *popelnicová pole*, the standard abbreviation, `pp` doubled for a
      plural exactly as in `pp.` for pages (@david-spacil, 2026-09-19).
    * `ssuti` / `ssutí` / `ssutě` are not artefacts either -- they are an old
      spelling of `suť` (@david-spacil, 2026-09-22). So of the eight tokens the
      guard was fitted to, FOUR are real language and four are damage, and the
      frequency gap the threshold sat in had vocabulary on both sides of it.
    * At full scale the table attests all eight, and zero of the 42,853 rows in
      the witness queue carried any of them. The guard fired on nothing.

    So attestation still does not by itself prove vocabulary, and a templated
    artefact can still be wrongly exempted here. That is a recorded, accepted
    limit with no known separating signal -- three were tried and none survived
    the full-collection table -- rather than a gap with a patch waiting.

    What this function does at full scale, measured directly rather than inferred
    from this docstring: `Mammalia`, `Triticum`, `Lepus`, `Linum`, `Arvicola` and
    their common epithets are all attested and exempt through this path once a
    lexicon is configured -- the taxonomic false-positive class this issue spent
    time on (see the corpus profile) turned out to be mostly this mechanism

    Detect structured archaeological measurement lines.

    The goal is to protect lines that may be noisy OCR but still contain
    meaningful measurements, dimensions, quantities, or physical descriptions.

    This predicate is deliberately conservative. It requires either:
      - an explicit measurement keyword with numeric context, or
      - multi-character measurement units (mm, cm, km, kg, ml, ha), or a
        bare metre unit glued directly to its number (0,4m), or
      - explicit measurement separator structures (e.g. v - 112, pr.okraje - 145).

    It strictly avoids classifying arbitrary digit-containing OCR or weak
    single-letter substrings/units as structured.

    Keyword/descriptor entries ending in a literal "." (rozm., pr., hl.) are
    matched WITHOUT a trailing \\b. A "." is a non-word character, so a
    trailing \\b can only hold when the abbreviation happens to be glued to a
    following word/digit character ("pr.okraje") — it silently fails whenever
    OCR (correctly) leaves a space or line-end after the dot ("pr. okraje",
    "rozm. 12", "pr. dna - 7"). The leading \\b is unaffected and still keeps
    these from matching mid-word; a lone hit still isn't enough on its own

# DORMANT candidate refinement to `_looks_like_measurement`'s `has_unit` branch,

# DETECTOR -- it exists only as a probe, exposed through
# `probe_spaced_decimal_metre_candidate()` and measured by
# `tools/recategorize_from_csv.py --probe-metre-candidate`.
#
# `has_unit` currently accepts a bare "m" only when glued directly to its
# number (`0,46m`), not when spaced (`3 m`) -- the latter stayed unmatched
# because a bare spaced unit alone is too weak a signal (see
# test_single_letter_units_and_probe_noise_rejected: "3 m", "o 5 m").
# Measurement against the 273-doc corpus found that restriction is now
# costing real coverage: 1,155 spaced-metre lines are unrecovered, and the
# quoted examples ("2,10 m", "215,5 193,120 m", "Z /193,445 m/",
# "Rovina profilu Z-V 214 192,740 m") are levelling/elevation readings, not
# noise. All of them carry a decimal separator in the number itself, which
# the rejected probes never do -- so a spaced bare "m" can be allowed
# specifically when the number is decimal-marked, without reopening the
# bare-integer case the pinned test guards against.
#
# Verified here to preserve every existing _looks_like_measurement assertion
# (glued forms, both pinned "3 m"/"o 5 m" rejections) and to recover the four
# quoted corpus lines, but the 1,155 figure above describes the *unrecovered*
# count under the current, narrower regex -- how much of it is actually
# decimal-marked (vs. some other spaced shape) hasn't been measured. Promoting
# this means replacing `has_unit`'s regex with the one below and re-running
# `tools/recategorize_from_csv.py` against the full local corpus to confirm the
# recovery and check for new false positives.

# ── rule_domain_notation ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Archaeological / administrative notation that `rule_short_garbage` and the
# section-1 perplexity routes must not trash. Deliberately NARROWER than
# `is_structured_line()`: consulted at those two places only, and conferring no
# other exemption, so it cannot silently disable rule_allcaps,
# rule_garbage_density, rule_zero_alpha, rule_vowelless or rule_mid_uppercase the
# way widening `is_structured_line()` would.
#
# Scope is NOTATION, not vocabulary. Grid/context refs, counts, abbreviation
# chains and labelled refs are shapes a regex can recognise. Latin binomials
# (`Equus caballus`, `Ossa tarsi`) and bare foreign words (`malakofauna`) are
# vocabulary, and are deliberately left to `rule_short_garbage` here.
#
# The scope line used to end "they need a lexicon, not a pattern". Keeping them
# out of THIS predicate is still right -- a notation regex claiming binomials
# would be claiming to solve the harder half of #30 -- but "needs a lexicon" was
# a claim about the whole problem and it does not survive: much of the garbage
# side is separable by shape (`_has_shape_garbage_evidence()`), and only the
# phonotactically legal residue (`edelite` against `malakofauna`) needs word
# knowledge.
#
# Dimensions (`12,5 cm`, `145-167mm`, `0,46m`) are NOT covered: they already
# match `_looks_like_measurement()`, so they never reach rule_short_garbage in
# the first place. A second copy here would only be able to drift from it.

#: (#30 D27, 2026-09-19) `STRIP_SYMBOL_GLYPHS` -> `_STRIP_CHARS` is a DERIVED

#: `if STRIP_SYMBOL_GLYPHS:` line above `_STRIP_CHARS`'s declaration), the same
#: way `ROT_GHOSTLIST` and `_LANG_DIACRITICS` are built once from their own
#: sources -- but unlike those two, it was never added to the "not rebuilt by
#: `override_constants()`" list, so overriding the flag alone was a silent
#: no-op. This is exactly how `tools/ab_constant_eval.py` measured
#: `STRIP_SYMBOL_GLYPHS` true vs false as bit-identical on every one of the
#: 2,064 gold rows (issue #30 stage 07c): the flag moved, `_STRIP_CHARS` did
#: not, and every `.strip(_STRIP_CHARS)` call site downstream never saw the
#: difference. Mapping a flag name to the derived attribute it feeds lets
#: `override_constants()` rebuild it in the same pass, restored the same way
#: everything else here already is.

#: (#30 D26/D27, 2026-09-20) The SECOND form of the same bug, and the reason
#: `_DERIVED_FROM_FLAG` above was a fix for one instance rather than for the
#: class. A module-level constant built once at import is not the only way a
#: flag's value gets frozen: a ZERO-ARGUMENT `functools.lru_cache` function
#: freezes it too, on its first call, for the life of the process.
#:
#: `quality_word_set()` is exactly that. It reads `QUALITY_VOCABULARY_ENABLE`,
#: takes no arguments, and is cached at `maxsize=1`. `tools/ab_constant_eval.py`
#: runs both arms of an A/B IN ONE PROCESS, reference value first, so the
#: `False` arm caches `None` and the `True` arm is handed the same `None` back.
#: That is how stage 07b measured `QUALITY_VOCABULARY_ENABLE` true vs false as
#: bit-identical on all 2,064 gold rows with 0 discordant rows -- the identical
#: signature 07c produced, from the identical cause, written up at the time as a
#: population-coverage result rather than as an unarmed flag.
#:
#: Registering the flag against the caches it feeds lets `override_constants()`
#: clear them on the way in AND on the way out, so neither arm inherits the
#: other's answer. `_read_token_lexicon` and `_compile_vowel_run` need no entry
#: here: both are keyed on their arguments, so a changed threshold is a changed
#: cache key and they were never able to go stale.
