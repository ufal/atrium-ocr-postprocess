"""
document_hook.py — repo-local glue between this repo's stage scripts and the
hub-canonical `atrium_document.py` paired-hook model (atrium-llm-enrich#13).

Unlike `atrium_document.py`/`atrium_document.schema.json` themselves, this module is
NOT hub-canonical and is not copied byte-identical across the tool repos (no
para-drift enforcement here) — the grouping logic below is specific to how THIS
repo's stage scripts batch many documents' pages into a single run, which the hub
module has no opinion on.

Enablement is config-driven, not a per-script flag: a single `[DOCUMENT].JSON_DIR`
setting (or `DOCUMENT_JSON_DIR` env override) turns the hook on for every stage at
once, pointing them all at the same directory of `<doc_id>.document.json` files. Left
empty (the default), every function below is a no-op — standalone runs are
unaffected, matching rule 3 of the accretion contract.

Ownership note: every write here uses PROGRAM_NAME = "ocr-postprocess" (named "alto-postprocess" until
2026-10-01; `atrium_document.PROGRAM_SUCCESSORS` treats the two as one writer), the current name
`atrium_document.BLOCK_OWNERS` lists for this repo's blocks. Every stage's
ParadataLogger stamps that same `program` (classify, aggregate and the text-lines
stages import PROGRAM_NAME from here; the other stages spell the literal) and names
the script in `config.script`. The older per-stage names (`langID-classify`,
`langID-aggregate`) survive only in the 2026-06 sample logs under `paradata/`, so
atrium-llm-enrich#13's "normalise the alto-postprocess program names" TODO is done
(agent_dev_logs/plans/31.plan.md, Phase 4).

(#31 Phase 4) `SOURCE_ORIGIN_BY_KIND` — a per-kind `source.origin` override for the
text-lines inputs — is parsed and resolved here (`parse_origin_by_kind`,
`resolve_input_origin`), so text_split.py and the service agree on it.
