"""Repo-local declarations for tests/test_openapi_contract.py (atrium-project#32 round 2).

Never vendored, never in para-drift, never in the ruff [format] exclude — unlike the
canonical test that reads it, this file's content is per repo by design: which services the
repo runs, where their committed specs live, which settings could reach a spec, and which
requirement files pin fastapi and pydantic. See the canonical test's docstring.
