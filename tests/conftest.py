# ── The archive's allow list, held out ────────────────────────────────────
# (#30 Q5a/Q5b) Since 2026-10-01 `setup/word_lists.txt` `[allowed]` ships
# @david-spacil's reviewed entries, and a listed word is never evidence of damage
# to the shape witness. Tests of OTHER mechanisms -- the lexicon, the language
# split, the witness report -- use exactly those words (`ssuti`, `Dauerleihe`,
# `Kaukasus`, `Triticum monococcum`) as their "convicted by shape alone" examples,
# and would otherwise be measuring the list instead of the mechanism they name.
#
# This fixture is the shipped file with ONLY the `[allowed]` entries removed:
# every other section, and every comment, stays exactly as shipped. The list's
# own behaviour is pinned in tests/test_word_lists.py, at the shipped config.
