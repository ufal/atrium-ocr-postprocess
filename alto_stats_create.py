"""
alto_stats_create.py

Purpose:
This script scans a given input folder for ALTO XML files. It can scan
both the root of the folder and one level of subdirectories.

For each ALTO XML file found, it counts various XML elements (e.g., <TextLine>,
<String>, <Illustration>) using the statistics code path vendored in
`alto_tools.py` — copied from https://github.com/cneud/alto-tools (Apache-2.0),
which is what the `alto-tools -s` CLI used to do in a subprocess.

It then compiles all the statistics into a single CSV file, along with the
file/page identifiers derived from the filenames and the full path to the XML
file.

This CSV is the primary input for the next step in the pipeline


Dependencies:
- alto_tools.py (vendored in this repository; no external binary, no PATH lookup)
- pandas (Python library)

Usage:
    python alto_stats_create.py <input_folder> [-o <output_csv>]

Example:
    python alto_stats_create.py ./my_alto_files/ -o stats.csv

    its "# of <TextLine> elements: 33" stdout lines back into a dict. Both halves

    # "sbn.2019-1.alto.xml" became "sbn", so the stats CSV keyed a document that no
    # other stage had ever heard of.
