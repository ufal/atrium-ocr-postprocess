# 📦 OCR Output Postprocessing Pipeline

This project provides a complete workflow for processing **OCR output** 📄 and other text-bearing
files. It takes the output of OCR — ALTO XML, PAGE XML, hOCR, ABBYY FineReader XML, OCR JSON — and
transforms it into structured **statistics tables** 📊, performs text classification, and filters
low-quality **OCR** 🔍 results. ALTO XML, the format of the PSNC corpus, stays the worked example
throughout this README.

> [!NOTE]
> **Formerly `atrium-alto-postprocess`.** On 1 October 2026 the project continued in this repository under
> its new name, with the pipeline, the scripts, the categories and the scoring unchanged (the ALTO-specific
> scripts keep their names: they name steps that really are ALTO-specific). What changed: the repository and image
> names (`ghcr.io/ufal/atrium-ocr-postprocess`, `…-api`), the service id (`atrium-ocr-postprocess`), and the program id
> this tool stamps into the document record (`ocr-postprocess`; records written before keep `alto-postprocess`, which the
> record contract accepts as the same writer). The images of the old repository stay published for consumers pinned to
> them and receive no new tags; its issues and releases remain readable there.

The core of the quality filtering relies on **language identification** 🌐 and a composite **quality
score** 📈 — combining structural detectors, **perplexity** 📉, and character-level metrics — to identify
and categorize noisy or unreliable **OCR** 🔍 output.

Besides ALTO, the same categorization takes the other OCR formats (PAGE XML, hOCR, ABBYY FineReader
XML, DjVuXML, Tesseract TSV, OCR/Doc-AI JSON) and PDF, office, e-mail and plain-text files — see
[Step 1](#-step-1-split-document-specific-inputs-into-pages-) and the
[input formats reference 📚](docs/text_inputs.md#formats-and-their-standards).

## ⚙️ Setup

Before you begin, set up your environment.

1.  Create and activate a new **virtual environment** 🖥️ in the project directory.
2.  Install the required **Python** 🐍 packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r setup/requirements.txt
    ```
3. Download the **FastText** 🌐 model for language identification:
    ```bash
    wget "[https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification/resolve/main/model.bin](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification/resolve/main/model.bin)" -O lid.176.bin
    ```
    The file is the Hub's `model.bin` — the NLLB fastText language-ID model, 1.18 GB, CC BY-NC 4.0 —
    saved under the name the pipeline's config expects (`FASTTEXT_MODEL = lid.176.bin`); it is not the
    126 MB fastText `lid.176.bin`. The Docker image fetches the same file pinned to a Hub revision and
    checked against its SHA-256 (the `FASTTEXT_REVISION` / `FASTTEXT_SHA256` build args in the
    [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) 📎).
4. Copy the `v3` folder from the 📐`layoutreader` 🔧 repository [^9] to the project directory for the LR-based text extraction method:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ppaanngggg/layoutreader.git](https://github.com/ppaanngggg/layoutreader.git)
    cp -r layoutreader/v3/ ./
    rm -rf layoutreader/
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> **Docker on Linux: run as yourself.** The published images are `ghcr.io/ufal/atrium-ocr-postprocess:<version>`
> (the batch pipeline) and `ghcr.io/ufal/atrium-ocr-postprocess-api:<version>`, where `<version>` is the release
> without its leading `v`. `./data` is part of the clone and belongs to you, while the images run as uid 10001 by
> default: `docker-compose.yml` runs the services as `user: "${ATRIUM_UID:-10001}:0"`, so put your uid in `.env`
> once — `echo "ATRIUM_UID=$(id -u)" >> .env`. With `docker run`, pass `--user "$(id -u):0"`. Docker Desktop
> (macOS, Windows) needs neither. (atrium-project#69)

> [!NOTE]
> There is no `alto-tools` 🔧 install step any more. The statistics and text-extraction code paths this
> pipeline used are **vendored** in [alto_tools.py](alto_tools.py) 📎 — see [Vendored code 📦](#vendored-code-).

You are now ready to start the workflow.

## 🛤️ Workflow Stages

The process is divided into sequential steps, starting from raw **ALTO** 📄 files — or generic
OCR **JSON**, or (#31) any other text-bearing file: PDF, DOCX, ODT, XLSX, PPTX, EPUB, RTF,
HTML/hOCR, PAGE XML, TEI, ABBYY/DjVu XML, Tesseract TSV, Markdown, CSV, subtitles, e-mail or
plain text, also compressed or as a ZIP of page files — and ending with extracted linguistic
and statistic data 📊.

You can run the **entire pipeline end-to-end** with a single command (see below), or run each
stage individually as described in Steps 1–4.

---

### 🚀 Run the whole pipeline at once

The [run_pipeline.py](run_pipeline.py) 🐍 orchestrator runs every stage sequentially
(**split → statistics → text extraction → classification → aggregation**) and, at the end,
**merges all per-stage paradata** 🗒️ logs into a single run summary describing every stage, the
intermediate file formats produced, and the **effective end-to-end output license** ⚖️ (see
[Paradata logging](#paradata-logging)).

```bash
python3 run_pipeline.py                      # all settings from config.txt
python3 run_pipeline.py --method glm         # override just the extraction backend
python3 run_pipeline.py --method json-keys --input-dir data_samples/JSON   # generic OCR JSON (#31)
python3 run_pipeline.py --method text-lines  # PDF/DOCX/TXT/... from [PIPELINE].INPUT_DIR_TEXT (#31)
python3 run_pipeline.py --skip-split         # PAGE_ALTO already populated
python3 run_pipeline.py --dry-run            # print the resolved plan, run nothing
```

* **Configuration ⚙️:** every setting is read from [config.txt](setup/config.txt) 📎
(section `[PIPELINE]`, with `INPUT_CSV` taken from `[EXTRACT]`). Precedence is
**CLI flag > config value > built-in default**. Point at a different config with `--config`
or the `LANGID_CONFIG` environment variable.
* **Extraction method 🔀:** `[PIPELINE] METHOD` selects the **Step 3** backend —
`alto-tools`, `layoutreader` (**default**), or `glm` for ALTO XML; `json-keys` for generic OCR
JSON; `text-lines` for every other text-bearing format (#31). The method also selects the
Step 1/2 scripts for its input format. The choice flows through to the merged license: a
**LayoutReader** 📐 run resolves to **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**, an **alto-tools** 🧰 run to
**CC BY-NC 4.0**.
* **`--input-csv`:** the page statistics CSV. Step 2 writes it, and Steps 3 and 4 read it — every
extractor and `classify_TEXT.py` take `--input-csv` (#31 Phase 5; the flag used to reach Step 2
only). Without the flag the ALTO/JSON methods read `[EXTRACT].INPUT_CSV` / `[CLASSIFY].INPUT_CSV`
as before, and `text-lines` uses its own CSV, `[EXTRACT].INPUT_CSV_TEXT`
(`data_samples/text_stats.csv`), which the orchestrator passes to Steps 3 and 4 — so a text-lines
run no longer overwrites the ALTO methods' `data_samples/test_alto_stats.csv`.
* **text-lines extras (#31):** without `--input-dir` it reads `[PIPELINE].INPUT_DIR_TEXT`
(`data_samples/TEXT`); `--strict` / `--no-strict` reach `text_split.py` and
`extract_TEXT_2_TXT.py` (a strict failure stops the pipeline); `--source-origin ocr:<engine>`
reaches the split stage of every method.
* **Output 📤:** a merged `<YYMMDD-HHmmss>_pipeline-run.json` in the [paradata](paradata) 📁
directory, alongside the individual per-stage logs.

> [!NOTE]
> Every stage — Step 1 (`page_split.py` / `text_split.py`) included — writes its own paradata
> log, so a full run merges **five** logged stages, and the dry-run tags all five `[paradata]`.
> The merged license is re-derived from the **union** of components used across all stages, so
> the end-to-end most-restrictive rule holds.

> [!TIP]
> Prefer to inspect or re-run a single stage? The individual scripts below remain fully usable on
> their own — the orchestrator simply calls them in order.

---

### ▶️ Step 1: Split Document-Specific Inputs into Pages ✂️

First, ensure you have a directory 📁 containing your document-level input files. This script
will split them into individual page-specific files — it supports **both** ALTO XML and generic
JSON, dispatched automatically by file extension. Every other text-bearing format goes through
[`text_split.py`](#any-other-text-bearing-input-pdf-docx-txt--31-) instead (`--method text-lines`).

```
python3 page_split.py <input_dir> <output_dir>
```

Each page-specific file retains the header from its original source document 📌.

#### ALTO XML input

* **Input 📥:** `../ALTO/` (input directory with **ALTO XML** 📄 documents)
* **Output 📤:** `../PAGE_ALTO/` (output directory with **ALTO XML** 📄 files split into pages)

> [!NOTE]
> `page_split.py` splits every ALTO version: the namespace is the root element's (v2, v3 — what
> the ATRIUM ABBYY exports use — v4, BnF), and each page file keeps it. A `.xml` whose root is not a
> namespaced `<alto>` (PAGE XML, TEI, namespace-less ALTO) is skipped with its root named; the
> [text-lines method](#any-other-text-bearing-input-pdf-docx-txt--31-) reads those. A re-split
> replaces a document's page files: pages the input no longer yields are removed, also when the
> input now fails. Tesseract numbers its ALTO pages from 0 (`PHYSICAL_IMG_NR="0"`), so its page
> files are `<doc>-0.alto.xml`, `<doc>-1.alto.xml`, …

Example of the output directory with divided per-page XML files: [PAGE_ALTO](data_samples/PAGE_ALTO) 📁.

```
PAGE_ALTO/
├── <file1>
│   ├── <file1>-<page>.alto.xml
│   └── ...
├── <file2>
│   ├── <file2>-<page>.alto.xml
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

#### Generic JSON input (#31)

Real OCR/Doc-AI engines don't agree on how they represent multi-page documents, so the JSON
path is detected heuristically rather than assuming one vendor's schema: a nested page-list
container (e.g. Azure Document Intelligence's/docTR's `pages` array), a flat element list
tagged with a per-item page field (e.g. AWS Textract), or — when neither pattern is found —
today's single-page-per-file default (e.g. pero-ocr, OCR.space).

* **Input 📥:** `../JSON/` (input directory with generic JSON OCR-engine 📄 documents)
* **Output 📤:** `../PAGE_JSON/` (output directory with **JSON** 📄 files split into pages)

```
PAGE_JSON/
├── <file1>
│   ├── <file1>-<page>.json
│   └── ...
├── <file2>
│   ├── <file2>-<page>.json
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

#### Any other text-bearing input: PDF, DOCX, TXT, … (#31) 📄

```
python3 text_split.py <input_dir> <output_dir> [--source-origin ocr:<engine>] [--strict | --no-strict]
```

The `<format>-2-txt` step for everything that is not ALTO or json-keys JSON: **PDF** (text
layer), **DOCX**, **ODT/ODS/ODP**, **XLSX**, **PPTX**, **EPUB**, **RTF**, **HTML/XHTML** and
**hOCR**, **PAGE XML**, **TEI/TEITOK**, the OCR exports **ABBYY FineReader XML**, **DjVuXML** and
**Tesseract TSV**, any other **XML**, **JSON/JSONL**, **CSV/TSV**, **Markdown**, **SRT/WebVTT**
subtitles, **EML/MBOX** e-mail and **plain text** in UTF-8/16/32 or a legacy code page (cp1250
first). A **gzip/bzip2/xz**-compressed file is read through (`scan.txt.gz`), and a **ZIP of
per-page files** — a Transkribus or eScriptorium export — is one multi-page document. Formats
are recognised by **content**, not by extension, so a misnamed file is still read correctly and
an unreadable one is refused with a reason.

Every file becomes an ordered list of **pages**, each an ordered list of **lines**. A page is a
real page where the format has one (PDF, PAGE XML, hOCR, ALTO, DOCX/ODT page breaks). Otherwise
it is the format's natural block: a sheet, a slide, a JSON child object, a JSONL record, an EPUB
chapter, a form-feed section of a text file. A line is the format's own unit: a physical
line, a paragraph, a table cell or a spreadsheet row. The standard behind each format, the tools
that write it and what this repo keeps of it
([Formats and their standards](docs/text_inputs.md#formats-and-their-standards)), the full
per-format matrix, the normalisation rules, the limits and the reason codes are in
**[docs/text_inputs.md](docs/text_inputs.md)** 📚.

* **Input 📥:** `../TEXT/` (any mix of the formats above — example: [data_samples/TEXT](data_samples/TEXT) 📁)
* **Output 📤:** `../PAGE_TEXT/` — `<doc_id>/<doc_id>-<n>.txt` per page, plus two reports:
  * `ingest_report.csv`: one row per input file, with its status (`ok` / `partial` / `error` /
    `ignored`) and reason code, the detected kind and encoding, page/line counts and the
    `source.origin` recorded;
  * `pages_report.csv`: one row per page, with its original label (sheet name, PDF page label,
    JSON page number, bundle member) and, for PDFs, the text-layer class (`none` / `garbled` /
    `ocr` / `digital`), a needs-OCR reason and report-only flags (`mojibake_cp1252`,
    `mirrored_text=N`, `rotated_text=N`).

A file that cannot be read costs **that file only**: images (`image_needs_ocr`), legacy
`.doc/.xls` (`legacy_office_unsupported`), encrypted, corrupt, empty or oversized files are
listed with their reason and the run continues. A file read with a possible loss (recovered XML,
a skipped bundle member, a stray CSV quote, a bad JSONL record) is `partial`: written, processed
downstream, its reasons listed. `--strict` turns any failure or partial read into exit code 1.
PDFs are read in an isolated child process with a timeout, ZIP containers and compressed files are
checked against bomb caps before anything is unpacked, and XML with entity declarations is refused.
A re-run never leaves stale pages of a document that now fails, and a page directory is only ever
replaced when it holds nothing but that document's page files. DOCX/ODT footnotes end the page
that cites them (`[TEXT_INGEST].NOTES`). All caps live in `[TEXT_INGEST]` in
[config.txt](setup/config.txt) 📎; each can also be set as the environment variable
`ATRIUM_TEXT_INGEST_<KEY>`, which wins over the file (atrium-project#53; the full list is
[service/README.md § Limits](service/README.md#limits)).

```
PAGE_TEXT/
├── ingest_report.csv
├── pages_report.csv
├── <file1>
│   ├── <file1>-1.txt
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

#### `source.origin` — how the original input was acquired

This is the pipeline's **first** stage to see the original file, so when
`[DOCUMENT].JSON_DIR` is configured it is also the first writer of the record's `source`
block (`sha256`, `filename`, `media_type`, `page_count`, `origin`). `source` is
immutable — first writer wins — and since the `atrium_document` §1a hardening its
`origin` is what **authorises** this repo to write the positional blocks
(`pages`/`content`/`lines`/`tables`), so that no document can end up with half an
OCR-derived plane and half a digital-born one. A value that matches no known originator
prefix silently switches that check off, which is why the resolution is verified and a
mismatch warns 📣.

| Input    | Default `origin` | Meaning                                                                                          |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ALTO XML | `ABBYY-ALTO`     | ALTO from the ABBYY toolchain the extractors already assume (see `extract_LytRdr_ALTO_2_TXT.py`) |
| JSON     | `ocr:generic`    | Generic OCR/Doc-AI export whose specific engine the file does not name                           |

For `text_split.py` (#31) the default is **truthful per format**. The OCR outputs are
`ABBYY-ALTO` (ALTO), `ocr:page-xml`, `ocr:hocr` — for an ALTO or hOCR file that names its engine
in its header, that engine instead (`ocr:tesseract`, `ocr:pero`, `ocr:kraken`, `ocr:transkribus`,
`ocr:ocrd`, …; #31 Phase 5) —, `ocr:abbyy-finereader`, `ocr:djvu`,
`ocr:tesseract`, `ocr:pdf-text-layer` (a PDF whose text is an invisible OCR layer under the page
image) and `ocr:generic` (TXT, Markdown, CSV/TSV, JSON/JSONL, TEI, XML, subtitles); a ZIP bundle
takes its members' origin. Born-digital documents are `digital-born-<kind>` (DOCX, ODT/ODS/ODP,
XLSX, PPTX, EPUB, RTF, plain HTML, e-mail, a PDF with visible text). A born-digital record is
originated by [`digital-convert`](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-digital-convert), so this repo then writes **only** `source` into
it: `document_hook` holds back the `pages`/`content`/`lines` blocks of every stage
(`atrium_document` §1a), except for the pages digital-convert flags `needs_ocr`. Those pages'
rows are written page by page, their lines replaced by this repo's, and every other page is left
alone (the OCR hand-off, atrium-digital-convert#4 W4;
[service/README.md](service/README.md#merging-an-ocrd-page-into-a-born-digital-record-w4)). The CSV
outputs of the run are produced either way. `--source-origin ocr:<engine>` overrides the default when the
files are known OCR output.

digital-convert reads PDF, DOCX and, since its v1.1.0-beta, ODT, ODS, XLSX and RTF (with this repository's
`text_formats.py`), so born-digital records of the other kinds (PPTX, ODP, EPUB, HTML, e-mail) keep `source`
only. The lines digital-convert does write can be scored on its record by `POST /score_record`
([service/README.md](service/README.md#scoring-a-record-post-score_record)). When files of such a kind really are OCR or transcription exports, say so per kind:
`[DOCUMENT].SOURCE_ORIGIN_BY_KIND = xlsx = ocr:generic, pptx = ocr:generic`. For text-lines the
precedence is CLI flag > env var > `SOURCE_ORIGIN_BY_KIND` > `SOURCE_ORIGIN` > per-format default
([docs/text_inputs.md §6](docs/text_inputs.md#6-provenance-sourceorigin)).

Override it when the engine **is** known — the prefix must stay one this repo owns
(`ABBYY-ALTO`, `ocr:<engine>`, `vlm:<engine>`):

```
python3 page_split.py <input_dir> <output_dir> --source-origin ocr:pero
```

Also settable as `[DOCUMENT].SOURCE_ORIGIN` in [`setup/config.txt`](setup/config.txt) 📎
or via the `DOCUMENT_SOURCE_ORIGIN` env var, so orchestrated `run_pipeline.py` runs
(which invoke this script with no extra CLI flags) can set it too. Precedence: CLI flag >
env var > config value > per-format default.

---

### ▶️ Step 2: Create Page Statistics Table 📈

Next, use the output directory from Step 1 as the input for this script to generate a
foundational **CSV** 📊 statistics file.

```
python3 alto_stats_create.py <input_dir> -o output.csv     # ALTO XML
python3 json_stats_create.py <input_dir> -o output.csv     # generic JSON (json-keys)
python3 text_stats_create.py <input_dir> -o output.csv     # text-lines (#31)
```

The three builders write the same columns. `text_stats_create.py` takes the document id from the
`<doc_id>/` folder, so ids containing `-` stay whole. It counts non-blank lines as `textlines`,
words as `strings` and PDF image objects as `illustrations`.

This script writes a **CSV** 📊 file line-by-line, capturing metadata for each page:

```
file, page, textlines, illustrations, graphics, strings, path
CTX200205348, 1, 33, 1, 10, 163, /lnet/.../A-PAGE/CTX200205348/CTX200205348-1.alto.xml
CTX200205348, 2, 0, 1, 12, 0, /lnet/.../A-PAGE/CTX200205348/CTX200205348-2.alto.xml
...

```

The element counting is powered by the **alto-tools** 🔧 statistics code [^1](https://github.com/cneud/alto-tools),
**vendored** in [alto_tools.py](alto_tools.py) 📎 (Apache-2.0) — see [Vendored code 📦](#vendored-code-).
No external binary is called and nothing is downloaded at run time.

* **Input 📥:** `../PAGE_ALTO/` (input directory with **ALTO XML** 📄 files split into pages from Step 1)
* **Output 📤:** `output.csv` (table with page-level statistics and paths to ALTO files)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This statistics table is the basis for subsequent processing steps.
> Example: [test_alto_stats.csv](data_samples/test_alto_stats.csv) 📎.

---

### ▶️ Step 3: Extract text from ALTO XML ⛏️

This script runs in parallel ⚡ (using multiple **CPU** 💻 cores) to extract text from **ALTO XMLs** 📄 into `.txt` 📝 files.
It reads the **CSV** 📊 from Step 2 — `--input-csv <stats.csv>`, else `[EXTRACT].INPUT_CSV` — and every
extractor keeps document ids such as `0001` as text. A page whose `.txt` is older than its input page
file is extracted again on the next run; one that is current is skipped (resume).

* **Input 1 📥:** `output.csv` (from Step 2)
* **Input 2 📥:** `../PAGE_ALTO/` (input directory with **ALTO XML** 📄 files split into pages from Step 1)
* **Output 📤:** `../PAGE_TXT/` or `../PAGE_TXT_LR/` (directory containing raw **text** 📝 files)

#### 1st choice: LayoutReader method 📐

> [!CAUTION]
> The model responsible for spatial layout 📐 analysis requires a **GPU** 🚀 to run efficiently.

```
python3 extract_LytRdr_ALTO_2_TXT.py
```

Uses the **LayoutReader** 📐 framework [^9](https://github.com/ppaanngggg/layoutreader) to extract text and bounding boxes of **XML** 📄 elements
(specifically, `<TextLine>` elements containing `String`s with `CONTENT` attribute),
process them to reconstruct the reading order of lines (columns-friendly), handle words split
between two lines (adding the full form of the word), and group page contents into paragraphs
based on the vertical spread of text lines.

Example of per-page text files: [PAGE_TXT_LR](data_samples/PAGE_TXT_LR) 📁.

```
PAGE_TXT_LR/
├── <file1>
│   ├── <file1>-<page>.txt
│   └── ...
├── <file2>
│   ├── <file2>-<page>.txt
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

---

#### 2nd option: alto-tools method 🧰

> [!NOTE]
> The method is **CPU** 💻-bound and faster than the LayoutReader method, but the text lines may not be in the correct
> reading order, and full forms of hyphenated split words are not reconstructed.

```
python3 extract_ALTO_2_TXT.py
```

Uses the `alto-tools` 🔧 text extractor [^1](https://github.com/cneud/alto-tools) — **vendored** in
[alto_tools.py](alto_tools.py) 📎 (Apache-2.0), see [Vendored code 📦](#vendored-code-) — to extract text lines from
**XML** 📄 elements directly, with no post-processing. Suitable for a quick overview of raw text content.
The output is byte-identical to what the upstream `alto-tools -t` command line produced.

Example of per-page text files: [PAGE_TXT](data_samples/PAGE_TXT) 📁.

```

#### 3rd alternative: GLM method (LLM-based) 🤖

> [!WARNING]
> The method is **GPU** 🚀-bound, slower than the LayoutReader method, and requires a `gpuram48G` card.

```
python3 extract_LLM_ALTO_2_TXT.py
```

Uses the **GLM-4v-9b** 🤖 multimodal large language model [^10](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/glm-4v-9b) to perform generative **OCR** 🔍 directly from
page images, prompted as `Transcribe all text on this page exactly as it appears`. The script
trims whitespace and resizes high-resolution images to fit model constraints.

> [!NOTE]
> This method is significantly slower than parsing **XML** 📄 but often yields higher quality text for complex
> layouts 📐 or degraded scans. It patches the transformers configuration to run the GLM-4v architecture.

Example of per-page text files: [PAGE_TXT_LLM](data_samples/PAGE_TXT_LLM) 📁.

#### 4th alternative: json-keys method (generic JSON input, #31 / #37) 🔑

> [!NOTE]
> Use this method with the [Generic JSON input](#generic-json-input-31) split from Step 1 —
> the other three methods above all consume **ALTO XML** 📄 instead.

```
python3 extract_JSON_2_TXT.py
```

Reads each page's generic OCR/Doc-AI **JSON** 📄 and walks a whitelist of informative keys
(`content`, `text`, `line`, `word`, ... — no assumption about a particular vendor's schema
beyond "text lives under a key named roughly `text`/`line`/`word`"), yielding the page's text
in document order, each text once at line granularity (see the note below). This is the **Extraction Layer**: it makes no other change to the
JSON and does not know about `doc.json` at all.

Example input: [data_samples/JSON](data_samples/JSON) 📁 (an Azure-style `analyzeResult.pages` document).

> [!NOTE]
> json-keys re-serialises each split page **with its document header**, but reads only the page:
> the page object a page file holds (Azure's whole-document `analyzeResult.content` no longer
> opens every page), each text once at line granularity (a line's `words[]` are not repeated
> after it; AWS Textract's `WORD` blocks are dropped when `LINE` blocks exist) — the rules the
> [text-lines method](#5th-alternative-text-lines-method-any-text-bearing-input-31-) uses for the
> same JSON (#31 Phase 5). On real AWS Textract responses and Microsoft's Azure example result both
> methods give exactly the engine's `LINE`s per page; json-keys used to write 3–6× as many lines.

##### `doc.json` accretion (issue #37)

When [`[DOCUMENT].JSON_DIR`](#paradata-logging) (or the `DOCUMENT_JSON_DIR` env var) is
configured, a second, separate **Accretion Layer** runs after extraction: for every document,
it reads back that document's already-written `.txt` pages and merges them into
`<doc_id>.document.json` as this repo's owned fields — `pages[].ocr`
(`ocr-postprocess`'s share of the field-split `pages` block) and the whole `content` block —
leaving every other block (`page_categories`, `entities`, `source`, ...) untouched, per the
`atrium_document.schema.json` paired-hook contract. With no baseline `doc.json` yet on disk,
the record is created holding just this contribution (accretion rule 3). This mirrors what
the other three extraction methods above already do.

`--force-single-page` is a **document-assembly policy**, not an extraction-rule change — it
only decides how many `pages[]` rows describe the pages already extracted above:

```
python3 extract_JSON_2_TXT.py --force-single-page
```

|                       | `pages[]` shape                                                                                                                             | `content.text`                                                           |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| default               | one row per source page (`page: "1"`, `"2"`, ...)                                                                                           | always the full document: every page's text concatenated in source order |
| `--force-single-page` | every source page collapses into **one** row (`page: "1"`), with `ocr.source_pages` listing the original page labels in concatenation order | unchanged — same joined text either way                                  |

`--force-single-page` can also be set as a config-file default —
`[EXTRACT].FORCE_SINGLE_PAGE_JSON = true` in [`setup/config.txt`](setup/config.txt) — so
`run_pipeline.py` orchestrated runs (which invoke this script with no extra CLI flags) can
still opt in. The CLI flag takes precedence over the config value when both are given.

---

#### 5th alternative: text-lines method (any text-bearing input, #31) 📄

> [!NOTE]
> Use this method with [`text_split.py`](#any-other-text-bearing-input-pdf-docx-txt--31-) output from Step 1
> and `text_stats_create.py` from Step 2.

```
python3 extract_TEXT_2_TXT.py [--input-csv CSV] [--output-dir DIR] [--lines-dir DIR] [--strict | --no-strict]
```

Prepares each page's text for categorization. Lines are normalized (NFC; control, zero-width
and bidi characters removed; soft hyphens resolved). Blank lines are dropped
(`[TEXT_INGEST].KEEP_BLANK_LINES`). Any line longer than `[TEXT_INGEST].MAX_LINE_CHARS`
(default 1000) is wrapped at a word boundary, because one giant paragraph would otherwise pad a
whole perplexity batch to the model's full context. A paragraph, cell or physical line otherwise
stays **one line**.

* **Output 📤:** `../PAGE_TXT_TEXT/<file>/<file>-<page>.txt` (what Step 4 reads)
* **Output 📤:** `../DOC_LINES_TEXT/<file>.csv`: the **line table**, i.e. the input's ordered
  text lines as CSV rows (`file,page_num,line_num,text,page_label`) before any categorization.
  Its `page_num`/`line_num` are exactly the numbers Step 4 gives the same lines in `DOC_LINE_CATEG`.
  The script refuses to write it into the `DOC_LINE_CATEG` directory.

Page files in any encoding are accepted, so a hand-made directory of page TXT files works
with `--skip-split`. With `[DOCUMENT].JSON_DIR` set, `pages[].ocr` (`engine: text-lines`) and
`content` are accreted like the other methods (not into born-digital records, see Step 1). A
page, a line table or a document record that fails costs that page or document only; `--strict`
(or `[TEXT_INGEST].STRICT`) turns such a failure into exit code 1.

---

### ▶️ Step 4: Classify Page Text Quality & Language 🗂️

This is a key ⌛ time-consuming step that analyzes the **text quality** 📈 of each page line-by-line,
assigning each line a quality category to filter out **OCR** 🔍 noise.

It uses the [FastText language identification model](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) 🌐
and **perplexity** 📉 scores from [Qwen2.5-0.5B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B) 🤖 to detect noise [^2](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) [^6](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B).

More post-processing of **TXT** 📝 files can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-nlp-enrich)
of the ATRIUM project, which covers NLP enrichment using Nametag for NER and UDPipe for CONLL-U files with lemmas & POS tags [^5](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-nlp-enrich).

As the script processes, it assigns each line one of five categories 🪧:

| Category        | Action                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Clear**     | Ready to be processed by further NLP               | Passes all structural checks; high composite **quality score** 📈.                                                                                                             |
| ⚠️ **Noisy**    | Corrections of generally readable words are needed | Partially degraded: moderate **quality score** 📈 indicating isolated symbol issues, fused tokens, mid-word uppercase, or elevated **perplexity** 📉.                          |
| 🗑️ **Trash**   | Should be re-processed by another **OCR** 🔍 tool  | Severely corrupted: composite **quality score** 📈 below the Trash threshold, or routed here by an override (unreadable all-caps line, inverted-scan page block).              |
| 🔣 **Non-text** | May be checked for identifiers of finds/sites      | Filtered by the CPU 💻 pre-filter: line is too short, has too few unique symbols, contains fewer than 30% alphabetic characters, or consists mostly of digits and punctuation. |
| 🫙 **Empty**    | Can be ignored                                     | Line contains only whitespace (paragraphs separator)                                                                                                                           |

Parameters that scale with the **perplexity** 📉 model:

These parameters must be re-tuned whenever you switch between multilingual `Qwen2.5-0.5B`🤖 and English-adapted `distilgpt2`🤖,
because the two models produce **perplexity** 📉 on very different numerical scales — `Qwen2.5-0.5B`🤖 assign scores roughly 3× lower
than `distilgpt2`🤖 on the same Czech 🇨🇿 text:

| Parameter                  | Qwen2.5-0.5B | distilgpt2 | What it controls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PERPLEXITY_THRESHOLD_MAX` | 1000.0       | 3000.0     | The ceiling used to normalise raw **perplexity** 📉 into [0, 1] for the **quality score** 📈. A value at or above this ceiling contributes 0 to the score (worst); a value of 0 contributes 1 (best).                                                                                 |
| `SHORT_PPL_CAP`            | 850.0        | 2500.0     | Maximum **perplexity** 📉 applied to 1–2 word lines before quality scoring. Short text fragments receive extreme **perplexity** 📉 scores from any LM because there is no context to condition on; this cap prevents legitimate short labels and codes from being unfairly penalised. |
| `PPL_INVERTED_MIN`         | 200.0        | 500.0      | **Perplexity** 📉 floor for the inverted-scan detection arm. A line is considered a candidate for the inverted-scan penalty only if the LM is also uncertain about it (**perplexity** 📉 above this value).                                                                           |
| `CLEAN_PROSE_PPL_MAX`      | 400.0        | 1000.0     | Maximum **perplexity** 📉 a line may have to qualify for the near-boundary `Clear` promotion (Override 4). Lines with **perplexity** 📉 above this value are not promoted even if all other conditions are met.                                                                       |

Parameters that are model-independent 🤖 and stable across different choices of **perplexity** 📉 model 🤖:

These parameters are expressed as ratios or quality-score fractions, not as **perplexity** 📉 values, so their meaning
does not change between models and their defaults are stable across either choice:

| Parameter                   | Default | What it controls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ROT_RATIO_INVERTED_MIN`    | 0.55    | Minimum fraction of structurally rotatable characters (`pbqdnuwmoxszeyv`) among alphabetic characters that must be present before a rotation penalty is even considered. A value of 0.55 means more than half of all letters in the line must belong to this ambiguous set. |
| `WEIRD_RATIO_INVERTED_MIN`  | 0.35    | Minimum mean per-word weirdness score required to *confirm* an inverted scan when `rot_ratio` is already above the threshold. This second condition prevents Czech 🇨🇿 sentences that happen to contain many `p`, `d`, `b`, `q` letters from being falsely penalised.      |
| `CLEAN_PROSE_MIN_SCORE`     | 0.65    | Lower bound of the quality-score range within which the near-boundary promotion (Override 4) can fire. A line must score at least this well before it is a candidate for promotion from `Noisy` to `Clear`.                                                                 |
| `CLEAN_PROSE_WEIRD_MAX`     | 0.08    | Maximum mean per-word weirdness a line may have to qualify for the near-boundary promotion. Even a single notably corrupted token disqualifies the line from being promoted.                                                                                                |
| `CLEAN_PROSE_WC_MIN`        | 4       | Minimum word count a line must have to qualify for near-boundary promotion. Very short lines (1–3 words) have unreliable **perplexity** 📉 scores and are therefore never promoted regardless of their **quality score** 📈.                                                |
| `MOSTLY_READABLE_VALID_MIN` | 0.85    | Minimum ratio of structurally valid words required. Semi-readable lines dipping below this ratio are capped at `Noisy` and prevented from achieving `Clear`.                                                                                                                |

Language- and collection-specific data 🇨🇿 moved from hardcoded Python literals into the config (#7 Tier 1). Defaults
are bit-identical to the previous in-code values, so the shipped config produces exactly the same categorisation:

#### 4.1 Classify Lines (GPU Bound) 🚀

This script reads the extracted **text** 📝 files, batches lines together 📦, and runs the **FastText** 🌐 and
**Qwen2.5-0.5B** 🤖 models. It uses a **CPU** 💻/**GPU** 🚀 split architecture:

* A single dedicated **GPU** 🚀 worker holds the only **Qwen2.5-0.5B** 🤖 instance and processes **perplexity** 📉 batches to
prevent VRAM OOM errors.
* Multiple **CPU** 💻 workers (up to `WORKERS_MAX`, default 32) read files, run **FastText** 🌐 and structural detectors, and
submit text batches to the **GPU** 🚀 worker via a shared queue. **CPU** 💻 workers poll the result dictionary while the GPU
processes, running **language identification** 🌐 concurrently.

> [!WARNING]
> The **first** item of `EXPECTED_LANGS` list of languages 🌐 should be the most expected language in the processed
> collection to work as a default replacement of ambiguous language recognition predictions.

```bash
python3 classify_TEXT.py [--input-csv <stats.csv>]

```

* **Input 1 📥:** `../PAGE_TXT/` from Step 3
* **Input 2 📥:** `output.csv` from Step 2 (`--input-csv`, else `[CLASSIFY].INPUT_CSV`)
* **Output 📤:** `DOC_LINE_LANG_CLASS/` containing per-document **CSVs** 📊 (e.g., [DOC_LINE_CATEG](data_samples/DOC_LINE_CATEG) 📁)

> [!TIP]
> This script is resume-capable. If interrupted, run it again and documents whose output CSV is
> at least as new as all of their page texts are skipped; a document with a page text newer than
> its output (re-ingested, re-extracted) is classified again. Output CSVs of documents that are not
> in the page CSV are listed in a warning, never deleted — `aggregate_STAT.py` aggregates every CSV
> in the directory. The Step 3 extractors resume the same way, page by page, and Steps 1 and 3 rewrite a
> page file only when its content changed, so a full re-run over unchanged inputs skips everything again.

`<doc_name>.csv` 📊: Detailed classification results for every single line within a document, **columns**:

* `file` — document identifier 🆔
* `page_num` — page number 📄
* `line_num` — line number, starts from 1 for each page 🔢
* `text` — cleaned text of the line 📝
* `original_text` — original pre-repair text of the line 📝
* `split_ws` — hyphenated word prefix at the end of the line (split word start)
* `split_we` — hyphenated word suffix at the start of the line (split word end)
* `word_count` — **count** of whitespace-delimited tokens in the line (**count** of **words**)
* `char_count` — **count** of total character in the cleaned line
* `garbage_density` — ratio of non-alphanumeric characters to total line length (calculated on `original_text`)
* `upper` — **count** of **words** with unexpected mid-word uppercase letters
* `repeated` — **count** of **words** where a non-standard character makes up ≥ 30% of the word, or containing consecutive doubled garble characters
* `ldl_fuses` — **count** of **words** with a letter–digit–letter sandwich (e.g., `vyt1ačená`), excluding valid measurements.
* `fused_words` — **count** of tokens that appear to be fused **words** (abnormal consonant/vowel runs or extreme length)
* `gibberish` — **count** of **words** flagged as gibberish (high vowel ratio)
* `weird_wx` — **count** of words with an abnormal density of 'w' or 'x' glyphs
* `word_weird` — mean per-word weirdness score in [0, 1]; combines strange-symbol (0.40), repeated-char (0.35), LDL-fusion (0.15), mid-uppercase (0.10), and a `WORD_W_PENALTY`-weighted (default 0.20) signal for tokens containing the letter `w` — rare in Czech and a strong inverted/mirror-OCR fingerprint — plus a separate caps-prefix penalty (0.20). The combined score is clamped to [0, 1]. Isolated single letters score 0.85 (OCR noise) or 0.25 (digit/measurement).
* `vowel_ratio` — ratio of vowel characters to total alphabetic and symbol characters in the `original_text`
* `rot_ratio` — the ratio of structurally ambiguous/rotatable characters (`pbqdnuwmoxszeyv`) to the total number of alphabetic characters in the line.

##### `<doc_name>.csv`'s key resulting output **columns** that depict the final classification and quality assessment:

* `quality_score` — composite **quality score** 📈 in [0, 1] based on **9** combined signals; higher = cleaner
* `categ` — assigned category: **Clear** ✅, **Noisy** ⚠️, **Trash** 🗑️, **Non-text** 🔣, or **Empty** 🫙

##### `<doc_name>.csv`'s **columns** useful for archive managers information apart from the **quality score** 📈 and category:

* `lang` — predicted ISO **language code** from the **FastText** 🌐 model (remapped if unknown)
* `lang_score` — **FastText** 🌐 confidence score for the predicted language (capped if remapped, #3)
* `original_lang` — predicted language **before** remapping logic
* `orig_lang_score` — original **FastText** confidence **before** remapping
* `perplex` — Qwen2.5-0.5B 🤖 **perplexity** 📉 score of the line 📉
* `caps_header` — **boolean** flag indicating whether all alphabetic words in the line are uppercase (typical of section headers)

**Diagnostic flags (#3):**
Ten boolean audit columns follow `caps_header`. Six name the categoriser rule that decided the line —
`allcaps_novowel`, `lowppl_clear`, `cleanprose_clear`, `trash_threshold`, `noisy_threshold`, `clear_threshold`
(exactly one `True`, or none for `Empty`). Two further internal reason codes — `trash_hard_sweep` (route 1a)
and `trash_inverted` (route 1b) — also exist but are folded into the `trash_threshold` column rather than
getting their own column, so the per-line reason granularity is coarser in the CSV than inside the categoriser.
Four name the document-level post-pass that later changed it — `pp_dedup` (header/footer mode-harmonisation),
`pp_surrounded_trash` (rolling-window smoothing), `pp_inverted_run` (page-level inverted-scan sweep), and
`pp_page_context` (page-context Trash/Noisy adjustment, see below).
A categoriser flag and a `pp_` flag may both be `True` on one line: that is the intended trail from the
original decision to the override.

##### Categorisation logic reference 📚

The full decision logic — CPU pre-filter, language handling, structural detectors, the composite
quality score, the categorisation gates/rescues, and the four document-level post-processing
passes — lives in **[docs/categorization_logic.md](docs/categorization_logic.md)**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Known accuracy limitation since `v1.5.0-beta` (issue [#30](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-alto-postprocess/issues/30)).**
> `rule_short_garbage` no longer convicts short diacritic-free lines on shape alone. Measured over
> both collections (113,101 documents / 71.8M lines) the change **promoted 367,208 lines and demoted
> none**, dropping `Trash` by 247,252 lines (−8.68%), and human grading of 484 promoted lines scored
> **76.5% right / 9.6% borderline / 13.9% wrong** — a 5.5 : 1 improvement.
>
> The cost is real and was accepted deliberately: roughly **26,000 genuine OCR-garbage lines now reach
> `Clear`** (95% CI [19,300; 34,600]). `Clear` is the top category, not a reviewable middle state, so
> **a `Clear` verdict on a 1–3 token line without Czech diacritics carries less confidence than the
> label suggests.** Downstream consumers filtering on `categ == "Clear"` should be aware of it.
>
> The narrowing that pays this down (`_has_shape_garbage_evidence()`, a phonotactic second witness) is
> implemented and wired, but ships **disabled** (`SHORT_GARBAGE_WITNESS_ENABLE = false`). It has been
> measured against the 2,067-line human gold set in
> [`tools/gold/sidecars/issue30_gold_2067.csv`](tools/gold/sidecars/issue30_gold_2067.csv) (see
> [`tools/gold/GOLD.md`](tools/gold/GOLD.md)): with the document-level smoothing it passes the adoption
> gate — errors 513 → 503, readable lines lost 38 → 38, McNemar p = 0.013, and 503 → 502 / 38 → 37 with
> the German/French vowel-run split — but it fails that gate per line, so the smoothing is a
> precondition. It stays off until the data providers' annotation of the population it would newly
> discard, and their agreement on what `Trash` means, are in. See
> [`docs/issue30/README.md`](docs/issue30/README.md).

To replay a config change over already-scored CSVs without a GPU, use
[`tools/recategorize_from_csv.py`](tools/recategorize_from_csv.py) — it reads the same constants and
calls the very same scoring function as the pipeline (`classify_TEXT.score_line()`), so a re-scored
corpus differs from the shipped batch only by the change under test. The FastAPI `/process` endpoint
uses that same function too; see
[Line Categorisation Logic](docs/categorization_logic.md), which opens with the three callers and
what each of them supplies.

#### 4.2 Aggregate Statistics (Memory Bound) 🧠

This script processes the `DOC_LINE_LANG_CLASS/` directory with **CSV** 📊 files in chunks 🧩 to produce
final page-level statistics. It is **CPU** 💻-bound and parallelized with `ProcessPoolExecutor`.

```
python3 aggregate_STAT.py
```

* **Input 📥:** `DOC_LINE_LANG_CLASS/` (directory with **CSV** 📊 files from the previous step)
* **Output 1 📤:** `final_page_stats.csv` 📊 (configurable via `OUTPUT_STATS`) — global page-level summary across all documents
* **Output 2 📤:** `DOC_LINE_STAT/` (configurable via `OUTPUT_DOC_DIR`) — per-document **CSVs** 📊 with the same schema

For each page, the aggregation computes features outputted in the following strict schema order:

**Totals & Counts:**

* `num_lines` — the total number of valid lines processed on the page
* `Clear`, `Noisy`, `Trash`, `Non-text`, `Empty` — integer count of lines in each category
* `total_word_count` — total number of words across scoreable lines
* `total_char_count` — total number of characters across scoreable lines

**Averages** (mean over the same `Clear` ✅ and `Noisy` ⚠️ lines):

* `avg_quality_score` — mean composite **quality score** 📈 in [0, 1]; higher = cleaner **OCR** 🔍 output
* `avg_word_weird` — mean per-word weirdness ratio in [0, 1]; 0 = fully clean, lower is better 📉
* `avg_lang_score` — mean **FastText** 🌐 confidence score
* `avg_perplex` — mean **Qwen2.5-0.5B** 🤖 **perplexity** 📉 score
* `avg_vowel_ratio` — mean vowel-to-alphabetic-character ratio per line
* `avg_rot_ratio` — mean rotatable character ratio per line
* `ch_ratio` — mean fraction of lines flagged as all-caps headers (`caps_header = True`)

**Language profile:**

* `main_lang` — the statistical mode (most frequent) language 🌐 predicted for the page

> [!NOTE]
> `avg_*` columns and `main_lang` will be `NaN` / `None` for pages whose only lines are
> `Empty` or `Non-text` (i.e., pages with no scoreable text content).
> Additional per-line diagnostic variables (e.g. `weird_wx`, `original_lang`, `original_text`) and flags added
> and ignored for this page-level aggregation to ensure stability.

All numeric averages are rounded to 4 decimal places; totals are stored as integers.

```
DOC_LINE_STAT/
├── stats_<docname1>.csv
├── stats_<docname2>.csv
└── ...
```

This is the end of the text quality classification and filtering step. You can now use [arup_page_stats_SHORT.csv](data_samples/arup_page_stats_SHORT.csv) 📎 to
identify files that need another round of **OCR** 🔍 or manual correction based on the line type counts. Pages with the
majority of **Clear** ✅ lines can be marked for further processing. The absence of clear lines combined with a high proportion
of **Trash** 🗑️ lines may also indicate handwritten content, which can be excluded before Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is applied.

## API Service Integration

In addition to the batch pipeline, this repository ships with a FastAPI wrapper (`service/text_api.py`) that exposes
the core `text_util_langID` quality classification engine over HTTP. The `/process` endpoint accepts ALTO XML,
plain-text, and generic JSON uploads (`task_type` `alto` / `text` / `json`, or `auto`-detected from the file
extension), returning the same per-line classification fields as the batch pipeline for all three formats.
(#31) It also accepts **every text-lines format** (PDF, DOCX, ODT, XLSX, PPTX, EPUB, RTF, HTML/hOCR, PAGE XML,
TEI, ABBYY/DjVu XML, Tesseract TSV, Markdown, CSV/TSV, JSONL, SRT/VTT, EML/MBOX, compressed files and ZIP bundles)
as `task_type` `document`. `auto` keeps `.txt`/`.json` as before and decides `.xml` and every other upload
**from its bytes**: an uncompressed ALTO root stays on the ALTO path, a file of a kind the service does not read is
a 415 `unsupported_media_type` naming the reader's code (a 400 before atrium-project#32 round 2), a supported file
that cannot be read — a document without a single text line
included (`no_text`) — is a 422, and one over a `[TEXT_INGEST]` size or count cap is a 413 `limit_exceeded`.
Document results carry `page`/`page_label` per line and a `pages` summary, and are read and shaped by the same
`text_formats.py` code and the same `[TEXT_INGEST]` settings as the batch method; a `.txt` upload
is decoded the same way (any common encoding, cp1250 first).

The batch pipeline and the API service share the same `text_util_langID` categorization engine and `config.txt`
settings — including the default **Qwen2.5-0.5B** 🤖 perplexity model — to ensure zero drift between local processing
and web uploads.

For deployment instructions, endpoint specifications (`/process`, `/info`), and frontend integration details,
please see the dedicated **[Service Documentation](service/README.md)**.

## Paradata logging

This project incorporates a unified provenance and **paradata** 🗒️ logging system to seamlessly track the execution
details of every pipeline stage. The logger automatically captures run-time metadata and saves it in a
structured **JSON** 📄 format.

**What gets logged?**

* **Provenance 🏛️:** Captures the tool name, a tool **version** 🏷️ tag, the repository/runner reference, the running
container image (when set), the **Python** 🐍 version, and assigns a unique `run_id` to each execution. The repository
reference is resolved **dynamically** — environment overrides (`ATRIUM_RUNNER_REPO`, `ATRIUM_RUNNER_REF`,
`ATRIUM_RUNNER_IMAGE`) take precedence over the static fallback in [para_config.txt](setup/para_config.txt) 📎 — so the log
points at the image actually executing rather than a fixed fork.
* **Output license ⚖️:** Computes the **effective output license** 📜 of the run from the licensed components it actually
exercised, and records it as `license` / `license_url` plus a detailed `license_detail` block (per-component licenses,
which component(s) `determined_by` the result, `is_non_commercial` / `is_share_alike` flags, and any unknown licenses).
See [Output licensing](#output-licensing-) below.
* **Configuration ⚙️:** Stores run-time configuration ⚙️, including script
names, input/output paths, and specific model choices.
* **Timing ⏱️:** Records precise UTC start times, end times, and the total duration of the run in seconds.
* **Statistics 📊:** Tracks the total number of input files, successfully processed documents, and computes performance
throughput (e.g., output files generated per minute).
* **Error Tracking 🐛:** Maintains a `skipped_files_detail` list that logs the exact filename and specific error reason
if a file fails to process.

**Log Location**

By default, **JSON** 📄 logs are written to the [paradata](paradata) 📁 directory following the naming convention
`<YYMMDD-HHmmss>_<program>.json`. Paradata is intended to live alongside the **outputs** 📤 (not committed to the
repository); the **paradata** 🗒️ JSON files themselves are distributed under the **CC BY-NC 4.0** license.

---

### Output licensing ⚖️

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The license of the files a run **produces** is **not fixed** — it is computed per run as the **most restrictive**
> license among the components (models, data, APIs) that the run actually used. The mechanism is data-driven via
> [para_config.txt](setup/para_config.txt) 📎 (component → license) and [para_licenses.py](para_licenses.py) 📎
> (restrictiveness ranking + share-alike / non-commercial rules), so the licensing owner can adjust it without touching
> the logger.

Each repository ships a [para_config.txt](setup/para_config.txt) 📎 listing its components. Components flagged `always` count
toward every run (the worst-case baseline); components flagged `conditional` are only counted when the script that uses

[^p]: pypdfium2 is dual-licensed Apache-2.0 **or** BSD-3-Clause; `para_licenses` does not parse SPDX `OR`, so it
is recorded as Apache-2.0 (either is permissive). The text-lines readers use no other licensed component: DOCX,
XLSX, PPTX, ODF, EPUB, HTML and XML are read with the standard library and lxml, so a text-lines run stays at the
**CC BY-NC 4.0** baseline.

Because the always-on **FastText** 🌐 weights are **CC BY-NC 4.0**, the baseline effective output license for this
repository is **CC BY-NC 4.0** (non-commercial). Runs that additionally use the **LayoutReader** 📐 method escalate to
**CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** (non-commercial **and** share-alike), the most restrictive option here. A run that exercised only
permissive components would resolve to **Apache-2.0**.

> [!NOTE]
> The restrictiveness ordering encoded in [para_licenses.py](para_licenses.py) 📎 is a mechanical engineering
> approximation, **not legal advice**; unrecognised licenses are treated conservatively as maximally restrictive so a
> missing entry can never silently relax the recorded output license.

### Document record schema 📑

The per-document record this tool reads and writes — `<doc_id>.document.json`, the pair of the
paradata above — follows [atrium_document.schema.json](atrium_document.schema.json) 📎, schema
version **`1.0`**. That version is frozen as the hub tag
[`doc-schema-v1`](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-project/releases/tag/doc-schema-v1)
(ufal/atrium-project@`544298b`), and it is the baseline this tool implements:

* [tests/test_schema_freeze.py](tests/test_schema_freeze.py) 📎 checks this repository's schema
  against the frozen copy beside it,
  [atrium_document.schema.doc-schema-v1.json](atrium_document.schema.doc-schema-v1.json) 📎: the
  copy is exactly the tagged file, nothing declared at the freeze has been removed or renamed, and
  every change made since is registered;
* all three files, like `atrium_document.py`, are vendored from the hub and kept byte-identical to
  its `v1` tag by the `para-drift` CI check, so they are never edited in this repository. The hub
  additionally checks that every record shape the tools write validates under both the frozen and
  the current schema.

What may change after the freeze, and what a new major version takes, is in the hub's
[Freeze & conformance](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-project/blob/main/docs/document_schema.md#freeze--conformance).
[CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff) 📎 carries the same reference under `references`.

## Vendored code 📦

Some third-party code is **copied into this repository** rather than installed as a dependency. Vendored code
keeps its original licence; the repository's own [LICENSE](LICENSE) 📎 (MIT) does not apply to it. Licence texts
live in [LICENSES/](LICENSES) 📁.

| **Local copy**   | [alto_tools.py](alto_tools.py) 📎                                                                                                                           |
| **Used by**      | [alto_stats_create.py](alto_stats_create.py) 📎 (Step 2, statistics) and [extract_ALTO_2_TXT.py](extract_ALTO_2_TXT.py) 📎 (Step 3, alto-tools method)      |

**Only the used functionality was copied** — the code reachable from the two command-line flags this pipeline
ever called:

| Vendored                                       | Upstream flag   | Used by                 |
|------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| `alto_parse()`                                 | (shared)        | both                    |
| `alto_text()` / `text_from_file()`             | `alto-tools -t` | `extract_ALTO_2_TXT.py` |
| `alto_statistics()` / `statistics_from_file()` | `alto-tools -s` | `alto_stats_create.py`  |

Left behind, because nothing here calls it: `-c` mean word confidence, `-i` illustration boxes, `-g` graphic
boxes, the `--dehyphenate` / `--detect-hyphens` branches (this repo does its own de-hyphenation in
`extract_ALTO_2_TXT._dehyphenate`), the `argparse` command line, stdin input, directory walking and the
`--xml-encoding` sniffing path. Every deviation from the original is marked with a `VENDORED:` comment in the
file, as Apache-2.0 §4(b) requires for a derived work.

**Why 📌** (issue [#50](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-alto-postprocess/issues/50)) — `alto-tools` has no PyPI
release carrying the `-s` statistics flag, so it had to be declared as
`alto-tools @ git+https://github.com/cneud/alto-tools.git@<commit>`. That made the published Docker image
resolve a GitHub URL in order to build itself, and the end-to-end lane then re-installed a **moving `master`
inside the already-released image, at run time** — so what CI exercised was not the artefact being shipped.
Copying the two used code paths retires the `git+` requirement, the `shutil.which("alto-tools")` guard, the
`PATH` export and the run-time `pip install`, all at once, and replaces two subprocess calls per page with two
function calls.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The vendored code produces **byte-identical output** to the upstream CLI it replaced: the same page text
> (block/line separators, spacing, `<HYP>` handling, reading order) and the same element counts.
> [tests/test_alto_tools.py](tests/test_alto_tools.py) 📎 pins this against output captured from the upstream
> command line at the commit above, and re-derives it independently for every ALTO file in
> [data_samples](data_samples) 📁.

**Updating it 🔄** — re-copy the two code paths from a newer upstream commit, update `UPSTREAM_COMMIT` in
[alto_tools.py](alto_tools.py) 📎 and the table above, then run `pytest tests/test_alto_tools.py`. Golden values
in that file are upstream CLI output and must only change when upstream's behaviour genuinely does.
