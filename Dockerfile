# (#3) The per-document line CSVs now carry extra diagnostic boolean and string columns
# (including original_text, original_lang, and rule flags). This aggregation
# ignores them — page stats are unchanged — but a future revision could
# emit per-page rule-frequency sums from them.

# ── Distro security patches, applied at build time ───────────────────────────
# `python:3.11-slim` is a floating TAG, and nothing in this ecosystem bumps it:
# no repo declares a `docker` dependabot ecosystem (docker_gha_roadmap.md, H6),
# so the base layer is whatever Docker Hub last rebuilt. On 2026-09-13 that layer
# carried perl-base 5.40.1-6 with three FIXABLE CRITICAL CVEs — CVE-2026-13221,
# CVE-2026-42496 and CVE-2026-8376, all fixed in 5.40.1-6+deb13u1. The release
# gate in atrium-project's docker-tool.reusable.yml ("Fail the release on fixable
# CRITICAL vulnerabilities") blocks on exactly that class, and because the
# promotion step is `if: success()`, a blocked release publishes by DIGEST ONLY —
# the `:<version>` and `:latest` tags are never applied.
#
# It has already cost two releases: translator v1.0.0-beta (2026-09-13, both
# targets) and nlp-enrich v0.20.2 (2026-09-15, run 34970419474, all three
# targets). THIS repo had not been tagged since, which is the only reason it had
# not happened here too — the gate is `if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')`,
# so day-to-day `test` pushes never surface it. (atrium-project#53)
#
# `upgrade` rather than `install --only-upgrade perl-base`, deliberately. The gate
# blocks on *fixable* CRITICALs — precisely those the distro already ships a patch
# for — so the fix that matches the gate's own definition is "apply the distro's
# available patches", not a package name that has to be edited by hand the next
# time a different one is announced.
#
# CACHE INTERACTION, which is what makes this hold rather than run once: the build
# uses `cache-from: type=gha`, so an apt layer high in the file would be served
# from cache forever and silently stop patching. It sits HERE, immediately after
# the ENV block that embeds ATRIUM_RUNNER_REF, because CI passes that as
# `github.ref_name` — a value unique to each release tag. The ENV layer therefore
# changes on every release, busting this layer with it, so every released image is
# scanned against a freshly patched base while day-to-day `test` pushes still hit
# the cache. Do not move this above the ENV block.
#
# One apt layer, not two: the upgrade and the install share a single `apt-get
# update`, so the package lists are fetched once and removed once.
# Guarded by tests/test_dockerfile_security_layer.py (atrium-project#53).

# 1) deps first for layer caching. CPU torch pinned, then the unpinned `torch`

#    Runtime requirements only (atrium-project#69, roadmap H4). The image used to install
#    setup/requirements-test.txt (pytest, pytest-cov, httpx, openapi-spec-validator, PyYAML)
#    and setup/requirements-sweep.txt (optuna, SALib, scikit-learn, matplotlib) as well --
#    the sweep file against its own header ("NOT needed by the production pipeline"). Nothing
#    the ENTRYPOINTs reach imports a package only those two carry: the tests run on the CI
#    runner, and the constant sweep (tools/run_optim_pipeline.sh) runs in a host venv and
#    installs its own extras. fastapi/pydantic keep their exact pins in service/requirements.txt.

#
#    (#50 rider) Pinned to a commit. `--depth 1` on a branch resolves to whatever
#    the tip is on the day of the build, so two builds a week apart could ship
#    different LayoutReader helpers under the same image tag. A shallow clone
#    cannot take a SHA via `--branch`, hence init + fetch --depth 1 <sha>.

# 3) Non-root runtime user, created BEFORE the weights (atrium-project#69), so the 1.18 GB
#    file below is written with its final ownership in its own layer. It used to be

# 4) FastText LID weights -> $MODEL_DIR/lid.176.bin, symlinked to the bare CWD path the
#    batch pipeline loads (classify_TEXT.py:516's FASTTEXT_MODEL default, loaded at :530).
#
#    WHAT THE FILE IS. `facebook/fasttext-language-identification`'s `model.bin`: the NLLB
#    project's fastText language-ID model, 1,176,355,829 bytes, CC BY-NC 4.0 -- NOT the
#    126 MB fastText `lid.176.bin` its local name suggests. The name stays (roadmap H3's
#    rename is retired): it is the default in classify_TEXT.py:516, setup/config.txt:83,
#    service/text_inference.py:83, tools/quality_model/ and tests/test_config_constants.py,
#    and the alto-models volume is seeded from the image only when it is EMPTY, so a renamed
#    file would never reach an existing volume.
#
#    PINNED AND CHECKSUMMED (roadmap H3). The URL names a Hub commit, not `main`, and the
#    file must match the LFS SHA-256 and size. The revision and checksum below are the
#    verified values for facebook/fasttext-language-identification/model.bin. The build
#    still FAILS CLOSED if either value is overridden to empty.
#    To refresh these values from the Hub, inspect the headers of the unpinned URL (no redirect):
#      curl -sI https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification/resolve/main/model.bin \
#        | grep -iE '^(x-repo-commit|x-linked-etag|x-linked-size):'
#    x-repo-commit -> FASTTEXT_REVISION; x-linked-etag (without the quotes) -> FASTTEXT_SHA256;
#    x-linked-size must equal FASTTEXT_SIZE.
#
#    Hardened fetch, as before:
#      * follows the canonical ?download=true redirect to the LFS CDN,
#      * sends a non-empty User-Agent (Cloudflare rejects some empty-UA bots),
#      * retries transient HTTP errors and connection drops with backoff,
#      * resumes (--continue) the 1.18 GB download instead of restarting it.
#    `-nv` keeps the log readable while still surfacing errors (unlike `-q`). The size
#    check runs before the checksum only so that a truncated body or an HTML error page is
#    named as such; the checksum is what makes the file the pinned one.

# API image was ever published and there was nothing for ARÚP/ARÚB to deploy on
