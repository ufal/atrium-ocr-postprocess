# 🗂️ Line Categorisation Logic

Reference documentation for the per-line quality categoriser implemented in
[`text_util.py`](../text_util.py) and driven by [`classify_TEXT.py`](../classify_TEXT.py)
(pipeline Step 4.1).

This page was split out of the top-level [`README.md`](../README.md), where it had grown to
roughly half the file. The README keeps the *operational* view — how to run Step 4, what the
output CSVs contain — and links here for the decision logic itself.

## CPU 💻 Pre-filter

Before any **GPU** 🚀 or model inference, `pre_filter_line()` applies a fast **CPU** 💻-side check and assigns `Empty` or `Non-text`
directly, bypassing the ML pipeline entirely. It also applies two lightweight **OCR** 🔍 text repairs to every line before
the rules are evaluated.

Firstly, two fixes correct the most common systematic **OCR** 🔍 substitution errors before any rule is checked. They modify
the text that is passed forward but do not on their own affect what category a line receives.

* **Digit-for-letter substitution:** A `1` surrounded by alphabetic characters on both sides is replaced with `l`
(e.g., `poh1ed` → `pohled`); a `2` at the start of a token followed immediately by a lowercase letter is replaced
with `z`. These substitutions reflect common **OCR** 🔍 confusions between visually similar characters.
* **Spaced-letter collapse:** A sequence of individually spaced single uppercase letters (`P R A H A`) is recognised
as a prostrkávání/spaced-text typographic style and collapsed back into a normally-cased word (`Praha`). Without this
repair, spaced words fail the letter-ratio check and would be discarded as `Non-text`.

1. Line is blank or contains only whitespace → `Empty`
2. Line consists entirely of digits, arithmetic/date separators, and punctuation with no letters → `Non-text` (e.g. `1998`, `5.3.`, `- 14 -`)
3. Line is a Roman numeral, optionally followed by a period → `Non-text` (e.g. `XIV.`, `iii`)
4. Line is a standalone alphanumeric archive or inventory code — a short letter prefix of up to 3 characters
followed by 3 or more digits, with an optional slash-separated suffix → `Non-text` (e.g. `A1739`, `CTX200205348`, `A679/2015`)
5. Line matches a stamp-like ratio pattern — a short alphanumeric string, optional non-alphanumeric characters,
two 2-to-4 digit numbers separated by a `/`, and optional trailing non-alphanumeric characters → `Non-text`
(e.g., `123/456`, `1998/01`, `NZ1998/01`)
6. Fewer than 4 total characters, or fewer than 3 unique non-whitespace symbols → `Non-text`
(lines this short cannot carry meaningful archaeological text)
7. Alphabetic characters make up less than 30% of total characters → `Non-text`
(the line is dominated by digits, punctuation, or special characters)
8. **Isolated Chars & Fusions**: A line dominated by isolated alphanumeric tokens, or a single token fusing letters, digits, and symbols → `Non-text`.
9. **Otherwise** → forwarded for ML classification as `Process`

Finally, the following categories of exception send a line directly to `Process` even if it would otherwise be caught by a `Non-text` rule:

* **Metadata marker bypass** — If the line contains any of the following patterns (checked case-insensitively),
it is forwarded as **Process** regardless of how short it is or how few letters it contains. These strings are
structural metadata markers specific to Czech 🇨🇿 archaeological report forms. Without this bypass they would be
discarded as `Non-text` because they are typically very short, heavily abbreviated, or contain mostly punctuation —
but their presence is meaningful for downstream NLP and archival cataloguing:

| Marker                                                    | Typical context in Czech 🇨🇿 archaeological records |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Tb.`                                                     | Table reference abbreviation (Czech 🇨🇿: *tabulka*) |
| `č.neg`, `č. neg`, `č neg`, `č.neg.`, `č. neg.`, `č neg.` | Negative number reference (*číslo negativu*)         |
| `neg.`, `neg `                                            | Negative reference shorthand                         |
| `obr.`, `obr `                                            | Figure reference (*obrázek*)                         |
| `č.`                                                      | General Czech 🇨🇿 number abbreviation (*číslo*)     |
| `str.`                                                    | Page abbreviation (*strana*)                         |
| `Datum`                                                   | Date field label on standard report forms            |

* **High digit-ratio bypass** — If digits make up more than 40% of the line's total characters, the line is
forwarded as **Process** regardless of its letter ratio. This preserves content-bearing strings that are intentionally
numeric-heavy: measurement records (e.g., `váha 90,9g`, `30–50 cm`), date strings (e.g., `5.XI.1946`), grid
coordinates, and catalogue references that combine letters and numbers. Without this bypass, most measurement lines
would be discarded by rule 7 above.

* **Forgiven headline / abbreviation bypass (#3, 2026-07-02)** — Lines recognised by `is_forgiven_headline()`
(short numbered headlines/captions such as `2, Popis nálezu i - 3`, and bare domain abbreviations/units such as
`mm`, `cm`, `Tb.`, `č.neg.`) are forwarded as **Process** even when they fall under the 4-character floor of rule 6,
so they are scored and floored at `Noisy` by the categoriser instead of being discarded as `Non-text`. See the
`forgiven` note in [Categorisation Logic](#categorisation-logic) for the full definition of what qualifies.

* **All-caps headline word (#3, 2026-07-02)** — A standalone all-caps **alphabetic** word that carries real vowels
(e.g. `LITERATURA`, `ARCHEOLOGIE`) is treated as a section headline and forwarded as **Process** for scoring, rather
than being caught as a code by the standalone-alphanumeric-token check inside `is_non_text()` (rules 4–5). Genuine
garbled codes are still `Non-text`: a token containing `X` (a classic garbled-**OCR** 🔍-code signal), a vowel-starved
all-caps run of 10+ characters, or any digit-bearing alphanumeric token remains `Non-text`.

## Language 🌐 Handling

**FastText** 🌐 [^2](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) is run on the **lowercased** line text and returns a predicted ISO 639-3 language code
(e.g. `ces` for Czech 🇨🇿, `deu` for German 🇩🇪) and a confidence score between 0 and 1. The pipeline then applies
a series of remapping rules (`remap_lang()` in [text_util_langID.py](../text_util.py)📎) before the `lang` and
`lang_score` fields are finalised for storage and before the score is used in quality computation.

**Configuration keys (in `[CLASSIFY]`):**

* `EXPECTED_LANGS` — comma-separated list of language 🌐 codes the collection is expected to contain (e.g., `ces,deu,eng`).
The **first** entry is the **default fallback language** used when **FastText** 🌐 predicts a language that is not in
either `EXPECTED_LANGS` or `TRUSTED_FOREIGN_LANGS`. If your collection is primarily Czech 🇨🇿, `ces` should be
first. If your collection is primarily German 🇩🇪 archival material, put `deu` first and adjust the **perplexity** 📉
thresholds accordingly.
* `TRUSTED_FOREIGN_LANGS` — comma-separated list of foreign languages 🌐 whose presence in the collection is considered
genuine and should be kept as-is. A language belongs in this list if you expect real documents or passages
in that language (e.g., German-language summaries in a Czech 🇨🇿 report, Latin citations, English 🇬🇧 abstracts).
Languages on this list are **not remapped** to the default, regardless of confidence.

**Language score thresholds (in `[TEXT_UTILS]`):**

* `LANG_SCORE_REMAP = 0.75` — the confidence value applied to unknown Latin-script lines force-remapped to the collection default.
* `LANG_SCORE_REMAP_FAR = 0.50` — the confidence value applied to unknown non-Latin-script lines (Hangul, Cyrillic, CJK, …) force-remapped to the collection default.
* `LANG_SCORE_ROUGH = 0.45` — a **FastText** 🌐 confidence below this is considered too unreliable to trust. This threshold
is used both by the hard-sweep override and by the page-level inverted-scan sweep (see [Post-Processing Smoothing](#post-processing-smoothing))
to identify lines/pages where **FastText** 🌐 cannot confidently assign any language — a strong signal that the content is not readable text.

**Remapping logic (applied per line, in order):**

1. If the predicted language 🌐 code appears in `EXPECTED_LANGS` or `TRUSTED_FOREIGN_LANGS` → the **FastText** 🌐 prediction
and confidence score are **kept unchanged**. No remapping occurs.
2. If the predicted language is `slk` (Slovak), it is considered a near-twin of Czech and is remapped to the collection default, but its **original score is preserved**.
3. If the predicted language 🌐 is **not** in either set and not Slovak (e.g., **FastText** 🌐 guesses Danish `dan` on a
Czech 🇨🇿 line) → the language 🌐 code is **force-remapped** to the **first entry of `EXPECTED_LANGS`** (the collection
default), and the stored `lang_score` is replaced according to the `LANG_REMAP_ALWAYS` switch below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`LANG_REMAP_ALWAYS`** (`[TEXT_UTILS]`, default **`true`**) controls how the replacement score in step 3 is computed:
> * **`true` (default):** the stored `lang_score` is **unconditionally set** to `LANG_SCORE_REMAP` (**0.75**, Latin-script guess)
>   or `LANG_SCORE_REMAP_FAR` (**0.50**, non-Latin-script guess), regardless of what FastText originally reported. A weak
>   *and* a strong foreign guess both land on the same fixed value.
> * **`false`:** restores the earlier *cap-not-floor* behaviour — the stored score becomes `min(original_score, cap)`,
>   using the same two cap values. A weak original guess is left untouched below the cap; only a confident foreign guess
>   is pulled down. A *confident* foreign guess on Czech archival data is evidence of inverted or garbled **OCR** 🔍, not
>   of trustworthy language ID, so capping (rather than flooring) keeps the stored score honestly low.
>
> Either way, this switch only changes the **stored** `lang_score`. It has **no effect**
> on `orig_lang_score` — the pre-remapping **FastText** 🌐 confidence — which is passed through unchanged and is what
> actually drives the hard-sweep, wqx/rotation, and vowelless overrides in [Categorisation Logic](#categorisation-logic).

### Two-tier trust score — *not* the stored `lang_score`

There are **three** different language numbers in play, and confusing them is the easiest way to
mis-calibrate the categoriser. Only one of them reaches the scoring logic:

| Value                  | How it is computed                        | What it is used for                                                                   |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `orig_lang_score`      | raw **FastText** 🌐 confidence, untouched | stored; drives the hard-sweep, extreme-perplexity and wqx/rotation gates              |
| `lang_score` (stored)  | `remap_lang()` — the cap described above  | written to the **CSV** 📊 and to the page-level inverted-scan sweep                   |
| **`trust_lang_score`** | `orig_lang_score ×` a trust multiplier    | **the `lang_score` argument of `compute_quality_score()` and `determine_category()`** |

The trust multiplier depends on how much the *detected* language is believed, and is applied in
`score_line()`:

* predicted language is in `EXPECTED_LANGS` → **×1.0** (unscaled)
* predicted language is in `TRUSTED_FOREIGN_LANGS` but not expected → **× `TRUST_TIER_TRUSTED`** (0.85)
* anything else → **× `TRUST_TIER_UNKNOWN`** (0.50)

> [!WARNING]
> The structural guards see `trust_lang_score`, **never** the remapped `lang_score`. The two

Because the unknown tier multiplies by 0.50, `trust_lang_score` for an unknown language can never
exceed 0.50 — which is below `LANG_SCORE_REMAP` (0.75). Gates written as
`lang_score <= LANG_SCORE_REMAP` are therefore **always true** for unknown-language lines, whatever
FastText reported. That is worth keeping in mind when reading the short-line gates below.

## Structural Detectors

Lines that pass the pre-filter are analysed by structural detectors defined in [text_util_langID.py](../text_util.py)📎:

| Detector                     | What it counts                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `detect_strange_symbols`     | **Occurrences** of any character that is not alphanumeric and not in the **allowed** set `{ . - , + ( ) " ' — – : % ; ? ! / }`. Edge punctuation is stripped before inspection.            |
| `detect_letter_digit_letter` | Words with a **letter–digit–letter sandwich** — the fingerprint of **OCR** 🔍 digit insertions mid-word (e.g., `vyt1ačená`). **Legitimate** measurements (`30cm`, `90,9g`) do not trigger. |
| `detect_mid_uppercase`       | Words with unexpected uppercase mid-word (`dalSÍ`). Academic titles (`PhDr`, `MUDr`) are **excluded**.                                                                                     |
| `detect_repeated_chars`      | Words with triple character runs, or double runs occurring ≥3 times. Exempts vowels `o, u` and digits to protect legitimate Czech 🇨🇿 doubles (e.g., *denní*).                            |
| `detect_gibberish_words`     | Words of length ≥ 4 with a vowel ratio above `VOWEL_RATIO_HIGH` (0.70). All-caps and mostly numeric words are **excluded**. Sub-tokens are split on internal punctuation first.            |
| `compute_rotatable_ratio`    | Measures the concentration of structurally ambiguous/rotatable letters (`pbqdnuwmoxszeyv`) to catch severe visual noise interpreting graphical textures as characters.                     |
| `detect_fused_words`         | Counts tokens that are likely multiple words merged without a space (token length > 14, consonant run of 5+, or vowel run of 3+). Sub-tokens are split on internal punctuation first.      |
| `detect_wx_words`            | Tokens with an abnormal density of 'w'/'x' glyphs (≥ 2 per sub-token). By default, this is folded into the gibberish ratio to punish severe mirror scans.                                  |

## Composite Quality Score

After structural detection, each line receives a single floating-point `quality_score` 📈 in [0, 1] computed by
`compute_quality_score()` in [text_util_langID.py](../text_util.py)📎. The score is a weighted sum of **nine**
normalised signals, **dynamically divided by the total sum of weights** to strictly bound the maximum
score to 1.0 (preventing score inflation):

```text
base_score =
    QS_WEIGHT_VALID_WORD  (def: 0.35) × valid_word_ratio
  + QS_WEIGHT_WEIRD       (def: 0.18) × (1 − min(word_weird_ratio, 1.0))
  + QS_WEIGHT_PERPLEXITY  (def: 0.08) × (1 − min(perplexity / PERPLEXITY_THRESHOLD_MAX, 1.0))
  + QS_WEIGHT_LENGTH      (def: 0.02) × min(char_count / QS_LENGTH_MAX, 1.0)
  + active_garbage_wt     (def: 0.18) × (1 − min(garbage_density / QS_GARBAGE_NORM_MAX, 1.0))
  + QS_WEIGHT_VOWEL       (def: 0.07) × vowel_quality_score
  + QS_WEIGHT_LANG        (def: 0.05) × lang_score
  + QS_WEIGHT_GIBBERISH   (def: 0.04) × (1 − min(gibberish_ratio, 1.0))
  + QS_WEIGHT_FUSED       (def: 0.03) × (1 − min(fused_ratio, 1.0))

quality_score = max(0.0, (base_score / total_weight) − short_penalty)
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is no `symbol_ratio` term and no `rot_penalty` subtraction in the current implementation — both

> per-line lexicon override and the page-level sweep described elsewhere in this document. `compute_quality_score()`
> still accepts an `is_upright_czech` parameter for signature compatibility, but it has no effect on the computed value.

> [!NOTE]

> [Categorisation Logic](#categorisation-logic). The two constants were previously the same value reused in both

> [!NOTE]
> **(#30) The archive's own allow list, `setup/word_lists.txt` `[allowed]`.** A listed token is skipped
> by the four per-token measurements — `score_word()` returns 0.0 for it, and `detect_gibberish_words()`,
> `detect_wx_words()` and `detect_fused_words()` do not count it — and `compute_valid_ratio()` treats it
> as non-evaluable, the way a unit is (it leaves the denominator rather than joining the numerator).
> Matching is exact and case-folded and does **not** fold diacritics. The section shipped empty until
> 2026-10-01; it now carries the entries @david-spacil reviewed (Q5a), the rest commented out.
>
> **A listed word is never evidence of damage** (issue #30 Q5b, answered yes by @david-spacil and
> @DanaKriv on 2026-10-01). Because a line made only of listed words has no gibberish and no
> weirdness, `rule_short_garbage` (gate 5) cannot open on it; and the shape witness (5c) skips a

**Dynamic adjustments inside `compute_quality_score()` formula:**

**1. Garbage Penalty Guard (short clean strings)**

*Trigger:* `char_count ≤ 12`, `word_weird == 0.0`, **and** `garbage_density < QS_GARBAGE_NORM_MAX`.

*What happens:* `active_garbage_wt` is **halved** from `QS_WEIGHT_GARBAGE` (default 0.18) to 0.09. A compensating
constant of the same amount is added back to `base_score` so the total effective weight sum is unchanged and the
maximum possible score remains 1.0.

*Why:* Short archival label strings — `Lokalita:`, `Osada:`, `Okres:`, `Datum:` — contain a colon or other
structural punctuation that is counted as "garbage". Since the line is short, completely structurally clean (no weirdness),
and mostly legible, the reduced weight prevents the label from being unfairly penalised.

**2. Short Noisy Strings Penalty (`SHORT_NOISY_QS_PENALTY`)**

*Trigger:* `char_count ≤ 12` **and** (`word_weird > 0.0` **or** `garbage_density ≥ QS_GARBAGE_NORM_MAX`).

*Applied:* Subtracts the configurable `SHORT_NOISY_QS_PENALTY` (default 0.20) directly from the final score
(the result is floored at 0.0).

*Why:* An opt-in penalty to sink very short noisy strings that might otherwise artificially float into acceptable score ranges due to their minimal features.

**3. Short **Perplexity** 📉 Cap (`SHORT_PPL_CAP`)**

*Trigger:* `word_count ≤ 2` **and** raw LM **perplexity** 📉 `> SHORT_PPL_CAP` (default **850.0** for Qwen2.5-0.5B 🤖,
**2500.0** for distilgpt2 🤖).

*Applied:* in `classify_TEXT.py`, **before** `compute_quality_score()` is called. The **perplexity** 📉 value
*passed to scoring* is clamped to `SHORT_PPL_CAP`. **The stored `perplex` column in the output **CSV** 📊 is not
changed**.

*Why:* Language models assign **perplexity** 📉 by predicting tokens. With only 1–2
words, there is almost no context available, so the model assigns extremely high **perplexity** 📉 even to perfectly valid words.
Without this cap, every single-word or two-word line would receive a near-zero **perplexity** 📉 component in its **quality score** 📈.

## Categorisation Logic

Categorisation is a two-function split: `determine_category()` in [text_util_langID.py](../text_util.py)📎 holds
all of the routing logic and returns `(category, reason)`; `categorize_line()` is now a thin wrapper that calls
`determine_category()` and then clamps the stored `quality_score` to the range consistent with the returned category
so downstream analytics can rely on the score as a monotone proxy for category rank.

> [!NOTE]
> An earlier revision applied cumulative penalty subtractions to `quality_score` directly inside `categorize_line()`
> before threshold routing (visible as a commented-out block in the source). The current implementation replaces
> that cumulative-subtraction approach with the strict, ordered gate list below — the quality score itself is never
> mutated during categorisation, only read.

Checked in order — the **first** match wins and skips all remaining checks, including the quality-score band routing.
Every gate below is individually toggleable via the ablation kill-switch (`DISABLED_RULES`) and, when active, calls
`_fire(<rule_name>)` for the rule-fire coverage instrumentation (`tools/rule_coverage_report.py`).

A category *name* rather than a switch, because this line has had three answers in the issue (`Trash`, then `Noisy` via D33, then `Clear` under @david-spacil's legibility definition, confirmed with @DanaKriv as Q4 on 2026-10-01). Reported under the matching threshold reason (`clear_threshold`, `noisy_threshold`, `trash_threshold`) or the pre-filter's (`non_text`, `empty`). Listed in `CONFIG_GATED_RULES`, so the rule-coverage sweep reports it `INERT`, not `DEAD`, whenever it is emptied. Known limit: a mis-scanned address gets the same category as a correct one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Recorded as `trash_threshold`. It does **not** consult `check_rescues()`. Since `070620f` (issue #30) it no longer returns unconditionally: it convicts only when `quality_score < CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX + 0.35` **and** a second witness holds. On the short diacritic-free population `_has_strong_garbage_evidence()` returns `False` for *everything* — garbage and real domain vocabulary alike — so requiring it here was a suspension of the rule rather than a narrowing, at a measured cost of roughly **26,000 garbage lines reaching `Clear`**. `_has_shape_garbage_evidence()` (`SHORT_GARBAGE_WITNESS_ENABLE`, **off by default**) is the second witness that does discriminate; it is now wired here as an additional disjunct and is documented under §5c below. This is the **only** site in the short-line path that returns `Trash` — section 7's `damage` branch returns `Noisy` — which is why the witness belongs here and nowhere else.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

It deliberately does **not** reuse `detect_fused_words()`'s other two clauses: `len(core) > 14` flags `Skelettmaterial`, and the 5+ consonant run flags `vrstva`, `ctvrtek`, `zmrzl` — ordinary diacritic-free Czech. The language label is the RAW `original_lang`, never the stored `lang`, which `remap_lang()` rewrites to Czech; a caller that passes no label gets the strict threshold. **Known limits:** the phonotactically legal residue (`edelite`, `vfetennl k.`) is out of reach by construction and needs a lexicon (#30 D14), with an optional `no_vocabulary` clause behind `SHORT_GARBAGE_LEXICON_CONVICT` (false); and the language label on a short damaged line is often wrong (#30 Z5). **Measured against the 2,064 scored rows of the gold sidecar** (`tools/gold/sidecars/issue30_gold_2067.csv`): with the document cascade it passes the adoption gate — errors 513 → 503, `Clear`-loss 38 → 38, 12 fixes / 2 breaks, p = 0.013, and 503 → 502 / 38 → 37 with the language split; per line (`--no-postprocessing`) it fails it, `Clear`-loss 53 → 54. @david-spacil's independent re-check of his 508 lines on the **default config (no lexicon)**, 2026-09-23: agreement 326 → 335/508 on `4ed309a`, 16 lines moved (11 fixed, 2 broken, 3 wrong either way). One of the two breaks was `S-VIIIb`, whose `_RE_FUSED_GRID_REF` guard had been deleted by an unrelated commit (`cc4990e`, 2026-09-18) and is restored and pinned by tests; the other, `Lokolieace: •VIII,` (gold `Noisy`), is damage a reader can decipher, which this route can only answer with `Trash`. **Confirmed by him on `3b02959`, with the guard restored: 336/508**, 15 lines moved (11 fixed, 1 broken, 3 wrong either way), `Lokolieace: •VIII,` the only break, and 0 of 508 changed with the flag off. **@DanaKriv's 357 decisions (2026-10-01, returned in place in `docs/issue30/census.csv` + `sample.csv`), text-only, no lexicon, after D46:** projected tail errors 4,844 → 1,180 of 5,646 lines, census head 339 → 358 of 558 (decipherable damage, which this route answers `Trash` — Q6), `Clear`-loss 0 in both. Before D46 her only two at-risk `Clear` labels (`XXX,1937,str. 21`, `okraj sekt.III,konec`) were convicted. **Stage 12, the same labels on the real lines, lexicon armed (2026-10-01):** on Dana's 826 lines errors 648 → 642, `Clear`-loss 1 = 1, p = 0.24 — the projection above is the witness's verdict on the text, and this gate consults it on about 3% of those lines; on the 2,064 gold errors 510 → 499, `Clear`-loss 38 = 38, p = 0.0034. The flip rule is met; the flag is held to be decided together with the proposed witness floor (#30 D47, stage 13). |

**Four late-stage penalty gates** (checked after gate 6, before quality-score band routing). Each one, if triggered,
only forces a Trash/rescue outcome when `quality_score < CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX + 0.35` (def: **0.90**) — a line that
already scored high enough is left alone even if one of these structural red flags fires:

| Rule name                   | Condition                                                                                                      | Rationale                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rule_wqx_rot`              | (`rot_ratio > 0.50` **or** `wqx_ratio > 0.10`) **and** `orig_lang_score < 0.75` **and not** `is_upright_czech` | Rotated/mirrored-glyph density or w/q/x-heavy tokens combined with a weak original language guess. |
| `rule_vowelless`            | `word_count ≤ 3` **and** `vowel_ratio < 0.30` **and not** `is_upright_czech` **and** the line is all-caps      | Short, vowel-starved, all-caps fragments (`WVL A`).                                                |
| `rule_ledger_fragmentation` | `len(words) ≥ 4` **and** more than 60% of tokens are bare digits or ≤ 2 characters                             | Table/ledger fragmentation loophole — mostly numeric or 1–2 char tokens.                           |
| `rule_mid_uppercase`        | `word_count ≤ 2` **and** any token has unexpected mid-word uppercase                                           | Isolated mid-uppercase fragments (`ClAŕ`).                                                         |

When one of these fires **and** `quality_score < 0.90`, the outcome is resolved by `check_rescues()`, in order:
1. If `rule_trailing_fill_rescue` fires (see below) → `Noisy` / `noisy_threshold`.
2. Else if the line is `forgiven` → `Noisy` / `noisy_threshold`.
3. Else → `Trash` / `trash_threshold`.

**`rule_trailing_fill_rescue` (`_trailing_fill_rescued()`)** — used both at gate 4 and inside `check_rescues()`: if
stripping trailing fill characters (spaces, `._:-–—<`) from the line leaves a non-empty, structurally clean core
(`compute_garbage_density(core) < CATEG_GARBAGE_DENSITY_HIGH`) that either contains a Czech diacritic or is short
(`word_count ≤ 4` and `len ≤ 25`), and `valid_word_ratio > 0.0`, the line is rescued rather than dropped straight to
Trash. This protects genuine short entries that trail off with punctuation/dashes (common in tabular archival forms).

**Witness floor** (`rule_short_garbage_witness_floor`, `SHORT_GARBAGE_WITNESS_FLOOR`, **off by default**) — applied
*after* the cascade in `categorize_line()`: when the cascade would answer `Clear` for a short line
(`word_count ≤ ISOLATED_CHAR_MIN_TOKENS`) that `shape_garbage_clauses()` convicts, the answer becomes `Noisy` /
`noisy_threshold`. It never touches a `Trash`, `Noisy`, `Non-text` or `Empty` verdict, it does not need the signal
half of gate 6, and it is independent of `SHORT_GARBAGE_WITNESS_ENABLE`. The page-level smoothing in
`apply_document_postprocessing()` acts after it, so with the floor on a line it created can still be moved to `Trash`
by the surrounded-`Trash` pass or page rule 1. Because it only ever answers `Noisy`, it cannot change the A/B tool's
`Clear-loss` (gold `Clear` → `Trash` / `Non-text`); the tool also reports `Clear-demoted` (gold `Clear` → any other
class) for rules like this one.

**Quality-score band routing** (reached only if none of the gates above returned):

```text
quality_score < CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX  (def: 0.55)  →  check_rescues()  (Trash, unless rescued to Noisy)
quality_score ≥ CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX:
    valid_word_ratio < MOSTLY_READABLE_VALID_MIN (def: 0.85) AND NOT lm_confident_czech  →  Noisy (noisy_threshold)
    otherwise                                                                            →  Clear (clear_threshold)
```

`lm_confident_czech` (`_lm_confident_czech()`) is true when `is_upright_czech` **and** `ppl < LOWPPL_CZECH_CLEAR_MAX`
(def: 180.0) **and** `garbage_density < CZECH_CLEAR_GARBAGE_MAX` (def: 0.15) — a confidently-Czech, low-perplexity,
structurally clean line is allowed through to `Clear` even if `valid_word_ratio` dips below the mostly-readable floor.

**Score clamping after category assignment.** `categorize_line()` clamps the stored `quality_score` 📈 to the range
corresponding to the assigned band, so the **CSV** 📊 value is always internally consistent with the `categ` label:

* `Trash` → score clamped to `min(qs, CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX − ε)` — always below 0.55
* `Noisy` → score clamped to `[CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX, CATEG_NOISY_SCORE_MAX − ε]` — always in `[0.55, 0.80)`
* `Clear` → score clamped to `max(qs, CATEG_NOISY_SCORE_MAX)` — always ≥ 0.80

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `CATEG_NOISY_SCORE_MAX` defaults to **0.80**, not 0.85 as stated in earlier revisions of this document. The `Noisy`
> band is therefore `[0.55, 0.80)` and `Clear` is `≥ 0.80` at default configuration.

### Why notation is *not* exempt from `rule_hard_sweep`

Reported on issue #30: with `SHORT_PPL_CAP` lifted, `II/C`, `1 ks` and `Reg.Bez.Aussig.` still route to
`trash_hard_sweep`, so exempting notation from the perplexity routes changes nothing for an uncapping
experiment. That is correct, and it is **deliberate**.

The three section-1 routes are not equivalent. `rule_extreme_ppl` and `rule_absolute_ppl` convict on
perplexity **alone**, and perplexity is not merely weak on this population — it is *inverted*: real
notation demotes around 3 000 while `oueussd` survives to 30 000. Notation is exempt from both.
`rule_hard_sweep` additionally requires `orig_lang_score < HARD_SWEEP_LANG_MAX` (0.45) — an independent
second witness that **FastText also failed to place the line**. Notation is not exempt from it.

The reason is measured, not stylistic. `_RE_NOTATION_ABBR` requires a capital initial per segment, which
closed the *lowercase* dot-chain hole completely (< 5 % accepted). It does not close the capitalised
one: OCR garbage is frequently capitalised, and `Vvbn.Slaot.Vansas.` is structurally indistinguishable
from `Reg.Bez.Aussig.` — **over half of generated capitalised dot-chained garbage is accepted by the
predicate.** Two narrower rules were measured and rejected:

| candidate rule                 | garbage still accepted | real chains lost    |
|--------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| a vowel in every segment       | ~40 %                  | `Kr.Hr.`, `St.Pol.` |
| majority of segments ≤ 4 chars | ~64 %                  | none                |

Neither earns its complexity, and both confirm that shape alone cannot separate these — the same wall
the *vocabulary* half of issue #30 runs into. So the predicate is not strong enough to carry a
hard-sweep exemption on its own, and a notation line whose language FastText also cannot place is
convicted. That is the safer error of the two available.

`TestNotationIsNotExemptFromHardSweep` pins the hole as **still present**; if a future change closes it,
that test goes red and the exemption becomes worth re-measuring.

## Page-relative perplexity (default OFF)

`SHORT_PPL_CAP` (850) caps perplexity for `wc <= 2`, and **the capped value is what is both scored and
stored** — the raw LM number never reaches the **CSV** 📊. Since 850 is below `HARD_SWEEP_PPL_MIN`
(1 000), `PPL_EXTREME_MIN` (3 000) and `PPL_GARBAGE_ABSOLUTE` (30 000), the consequence is blunt:

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **No perplexity rule can fire on a one- or two-token line.** For that population `rule_short_garbage`
> is the only Trash route that is not score-band routing.

Simply removing the cap does not fix it, because both surviving perplexity routes *also* gate on **low**
language-ID confidence — and on this population confidence is anti-correlated with quality: `oueussd`
scores 0.9163 while `malakofauna` scores 0.56. Uncapped, real domain vocabulary is demoted around
perplexity 3 000 while `oueussd` survives to 30 000.

`apply_page_perplexity_blend()` in [classify_TEXT.py](../classify_TEXT.py)📎 instead reads a short line
against **the long lines on its own page**, which is the comparison a human makes:

```
reference = median( perplex_raw of lines with word_count >= PAGE_PPL_LONG_MIN_WC )
blended   = exp( w · ln(own) + (1 − w) · ln(reference) )        w = PAGE_PPL_BLEND_WEIGHT
```

Both choices carry weight. The reference is a **median** so one outlier cannot poison a page — a page
containing a 6·10⁷ line still yields a reference near 39, where a mean would give 1.5·10⁷. And the
averaging happens in **log space** because perplexity here spans six orders of magnitude; an arithmetic
blend is simply the largest value. Fallback order is page → document → today's `SHORT_PPL_CAP`
behaviour, unchanged.

The pass runs immediately **before** `apply_document_postprocessing()` in both the live pipeline and the
offline re-scorer, and re-scores the affected rows through `score_line(..., apply_short_cap=False)` — the
smoothing pass only harmonises existing labels, it never recomputes a quality score.

> `apply_short_cap=False` is load-bearing, not a detail. `score_line()` applies `SHORT_PPL_CAP` to

Two **CSV** 📊 columns support it (40 → 42): `perplex_raw`, the uncapped LM value — required because
blending from the already-capped `perplex` would blend a constant, and it makes the blend re-tunable
offline with no GPU — and `perplex_blend`, written only when the blend actually moved a value and left
**blank** otherwise. Blending always reads `perplex_raw`, so repeated passes are a fixed point.

## Post-Processing Smoothing

After all lines in a document are classified and written to **CSV** 📊, `apply_document_postprocessing()` in
[classify_TEXT.py](../classify_TEXT.py)📎 runs three passes, **in this order**, before the file is finalized. This
same function is reused byte-for-byte by the offline re-scorer (`tools/recategorize_from_csv.py`). Together with the
shared `score_line()` above — and a shared row formatter, so both paths round every column identically before this
pass reads them back — production output and offline re-measurement never drift.

**1. Header/footer deduplication.** All occurrences of the exact same text string across a document are identified.
If the same string has been assigned to different categories on different pages (e.g., `Obr. 1. SKUHROV NAD BĚLOU`
is `Clear` on page 3 but `Noisy` on page 4 due to slightly different surrounding context affecting the LM), all
occurrences are harmonised to the **statistical mode** — the category assigned most frequently to that string across
the document. **Recorded as** `pp_dedup`.

*Why:* Repeating strings are boilerplate — page headers, footers, running titles, standard form labels. The same
physical text should receive the same label throughout a document, and the majority vote across its occurrences is
the most reliable estimate of the correct category.

**2. Rolling-window surrounded-Trash smoothing.** Scans the document line-by-line (documents with fewer than 5 lines
are skipped entirely). If a `Noisy` ⚠️ line is surrounded by `Trash` 🗑 on both sides in a 5-line window (positions
−2 and −1 are `Trash` 🗑 **and** positions +1 and +2 are `Trash` 🗑), **and** the line's quality score is below
`CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX + SURROUNDED_TRASH_QS_MARGIN` (default: **0.70**), it is downgraded to `Trash` 🗑. **Recorded as** `pp_surrounded_trash`.

*Why:* A single `Noisy` ⚠️ island embedded in four consecutive `Trash` 🗑️ lines is almost certainly corrupted text
that narrowly escaped the `Trash` 🗑 threshold. The score guard ensures that only near-boundary `Noisy` ⚠️ lines are
affected — a `Noisy` ⚠️ line with a quality score of 0.78 is left alone even in a `Trash` 🗑 neighbourhood.

**3. Page-context rules.** For each page, two symmetric page-level rules run on top of the categories left by passes
1–2, using `median_qs`, `clear_ratio`, and the fraction of lines in a trusted language (`decent_lang_ratio`, over
`EXPECTED_LANGS ∪ TRUSTED_FOREIGN_LANGS`):

* **Heavily-garbage pages:** if a page's `Clear` ratio is `≤ PAGE_GARBAGE_CLEAR_MAX` (def: 0.05), its trusted-language
  ratio is `< PAGE_GARBAGE_LANG_MAX` (def: 0.50), and its median quality score is `< PAGE_GARBAGE_MEDIAN_QS_MAX`
  (def: 0.55), every `Noisy` line on that page scoring below `PAGE_GARBAGE_NOISY_QS_MAX` (def: 0.80) is downgraded to `Trash`.
* **Predominantly-clean pages:** if a page's `Clear` ratio is `> PAGE_CLEAN_CLEAR_MIN` (def: 0.60) and its median
  quality score is `> PAGE_CLEAN_MEDIAN_QS_MIN` (def: 0.80), every `Trash` line on that page scoring
  `≥ PAGE_CLEAN_RECOVER_QS_MIN` (def: 0.45) *and* in a trusted language is promoted to `Noisy`.

**Recorded as** `pp_page_context`.

*Why:* A page that is almost entirely garbage rarely contains a genuinely-recoverable `Noisy` line; a page that is
almost entirely clean rarely contains a genuinely-unrecoverable `Trash` line. These rules use the page as additional
context the per-line categoriser cannot see.

**4. Page-level inverted-scan sweep.** Run last, independently per page, over every line not already `Empty`/`Non-text`.
A line is **suspicious** when it meets **any** of three detection arms:

* **Diacritic-absence arm:** the line lacks Czech 🇨🇿 diacritics **and** has a stored `lang_score < LANG_SCORE_ROUGH` (def: 0.45).
* **Perplexity/weirdness arm:** `perplex ≥ PPL_INVERTED_MIN` (def: 200.0) **and** `word_weird > 0.0` **and** `lang_score < ROT_HIGH_LANG_CONF` (def: 0.90). No `rot_ratio` requirement.
* **Rotation arm:** the line lacks Czech 🇨🇿 diacritics **and** `rot_ratio ≥ ROT_RATIO_INVERTED_MIN` (def: 0.55) **and** `perplex ≥ PPL_INVERTED_MIN` **and** `lang_score < ROT_HIGH_LANG_CONF`.

> [!NOTE]
> Earlier revisions of this document described only two arms and explicitly flagged that `rot_ratio` was computed
> but never actually gated the page-level sweep. That is no longer accurate: the current implementation adds a third,
> **rotation arm** that does condition on `rot_ratio ≥ ROT_RATIO_INVERTED_MIN`, alongside a perplexity/weirdness arm
> that (like before) does not use `rot_ratio` at all. There is no code/doc discrepancy to flag here anymore.

Suspicious lines are downgraded to `Trash` when either:
* they make up **≥ `INVERTED_PAGE_MAJORITY`** (default **0.60**) of the page's scoreable lines — the **page-majority arm**, checked first, applied to the whole page and skipping the run-based rule for that page; **or**
* absent a page-majority, they form a **contiguous run of `≥ INVERTED_RUN_MIN`** (default **4**) suspicious lines.

**Recorded as** `pp_inverted_run`.

*Why a page-majority arm?* Some inverted/garbage scans break up into many short, isolated fragments separated by
`Empty`🫙 lines, `Non-text`🔣 stamps, or single-token noise, so the suspicious lines never form a single run of four
and escape the run-based rule. When the **majority** of a page's scoreable lines are individually suspicious, the
page as a whole is treated as an inverted/garbage scan and every suspicious line on it is downgraded, regardless of
run length. Lines carrying Czech 🇨🇿 diacritics or a confident **FastText** 🌐 score are never suspicious, so genuine
content interleaved on the page is preserved.

*Why three arms?* Inverted-scan pages sometimes produce partial Czech 🇨🇿 diacritics: the **OCR** 🔍 engine recognises
some upside-down glyphs as plausible Latin characters and occasionally matches diacritical forms. The diacritic-absence
arm alone would miss these pages. The perplexity/weirdness arm and the rotation arm each catch them independently —
one using LM uncertainty plus word-level weirdness, the other using the character-shape rotation signal together with
LM uncertainty — without requiring the absence of diacritics on their own.
