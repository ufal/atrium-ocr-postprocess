page_split.py

Purpose:
This script takes a multi-page document as input and splits it into multiple
single-page files, ordered plain-text-adjacent stage 1 of the pipeline for
BOTH input formats it supports:

- ALTO XML (any version: the namespace is the root's): a document-level
  `<file>.alto.xml` (multiple `<Page>` elements under one `<Layout>`) is split
  into one `<base>-<page>.alto.xml` per page (``split_alto_xml``). Each output
  file keeps the full header and style information from the original file, but
  the <Layout> section only contains the data for a single page.
- Generic JSON OCR/Doc-AI output (#31): a document-level JSON file is split
  into one `<base>-<page>.json` per page (``split_json_document``), detecting
  the page boundary heuristically since OCR/Doc-AI engines don't agree on how
  multi-page documents are represented (see that function's docstring).

A re-split replaces a document's page files: pages an earlier run wrote that the
current input no longer yields are removed (``remove_stale_pages``).

Usage:
    python page_split.py <input_directory> <output_directory>

#: (atrium-project#10 D5) Default `source.origin` per input format. page_split is the
#: first stage to see the original input, so it is the record's first writer of
#: `source` — and since Issue #18 §1a that field is what AUTHORISES the positional
#: blocks (pages/content/lines/tables). Writing `source` without it left
#: `_assert_origin_consistent()` abstaining-and-deferring forever, i.e. the mixed-plane
#: guard was switched off for every real run of the repo it primarily protects.
#:
#: Each value MUST match an `ORIGIN_ORIGINATORS` prefix that resolves to
#: "ocr-postprocess" or the check silently abstains again — that is the failure mode,
#: not a loud one, so `resolve_source_origin()` below checks the resolution rather
#: than trusting the spelling.
#:
#:   xml  — the ALTO path. "ABBYY-ALTO" is the table's only ALTO-specific value, and
#:          this repo's extractors already document ABBYY as the producer of the ALTO
#:          they consume (extract_LytRdr_ALTO_2_TXT.py's header: "Trusts ABBYY's
#:          <TextLine>"). A deployment whose ALTO came out of another engine sets
#:          `SOURCE_ORIGIN = ocr:<engine>` rather than leaving this default in place.
#:   json — the generic OCR/Doc-AI path (#31: Azure DI, docTR, Google Doc AI, AWS
#:          Textract, pero-ocr, OCR.space). Every one of those families is OCR
#:          output, so the `ocr:` prefix is the truthful one; the ENGINE is not
#:          recoverable from the JSON in the general case, hence "generic" — the
#:          same spelling tests/test_extract_json.py already uses for this path.
#:          A deployment that knows its engine sets `SOURCE_ORIGIN = ocr:pero`.
#:
#: `source.origin` describes how the ORIGINAL INPUT was acquired, never how this
#: stage read it — which is why an override belongs to the operator, not the code.

#   pipeline default). Used as the fallback when neither A nor B fires, so
